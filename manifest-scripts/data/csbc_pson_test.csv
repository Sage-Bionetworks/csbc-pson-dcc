However, the disease remains incurable and is characterized by high rates of drug resistance and relapse. Consequently, methods to select the most efficacious therapy are of great interest. Here we utilize a functional assay to assess the ex vivo drug sensitivity of single multiple myeloma cells based on measuring their mass accumulation rate (MAR). We show that MAR accurately and rapidly defines therapeutic susceptibility across human multiple myeloma cell lines to a gamut of standard-of-care therapies. Finally, we demonstrate that our MAR assay, without the need for extended culture ex vivo, correctly defines the response of nine patients to standard-of-care drugs according to their clinical diagnoses.

Here we discover that tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer is driven by a regulatory axis consisting of a master transcription factor, its cofactor, and an epigenetic regulator. The oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2 conferred tamoxifen resistance by silencing the expression of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) cofactor GREB1. In clinical specimens, induction of DNA methylation of a particular CpG-enriched region at the <i>GREB1</i> promoter negatively correlated with <i>GREB1</i> levels and cell sensitivity to endocrine agents. GREB1 also ensured proper cellular reactions to different ligands by recruiting distinct sets of ERα cofactors to <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, which explains the contradictory biological effects of GREB1 on breast cancer cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogen. In refractory cells, EZH2-dependent repression of GREB1 triggered chromatin reallocation of ERα coregulators, converting the antiestrogen into an agonist. In clinical specimens from patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, expression levels of EZH2 and GREB1 were correlated negatively, and taken together better predicted patient responses to endocrine therapy. Overall, our work suggests a new strategy to overcome endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer by targeting a particular epigenetic program.<b>Significance:</b> This study suggests a new strategy to overcome endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer by targeting a particular epigenetic program defined within. <i>Cancer Res; 78(3); 671-84. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"breast cancer, endocrine resistance, epigenetics","Animals|Apoptosis|Biomarkers, Tumor|Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinogenesis|Cell Proliferation|DNA Methylation|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism|Epigenesis, Genetic|Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology|Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics|Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism|Female|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Mice|Mice, Nude|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Prognosis|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tamoxifen/pharmacology|Transcription, Genetic|Tumor Cells, Cultured|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","Animals|Apoptosis|Biomarkers, Tumor|Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinogenesis|Cell Proliferation|DNA Methylation|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism|Epigenesis, Genetic|Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology|Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics|Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism|Female|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Mice|Mice, Nude|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Prognosis|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tamoxifen/pharmacology|Transcription, Genetic|Tumor Cells, Cultured|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",resist treatment driven epigenet reprogram specif transcriptom favor refractori phenotyp discov tamoxifen resist breast driven regulatori axi consist master transcript factor cofactor epigenet regul oncogen histon methyltransferas ezh2 confer tamoxifen resist silenc estrogen receptor α erα cofactor greb1 clinic specimen induct dna methyl particular cpg enrich region greb1 promot neg correl greb1 sensit endocrin agent greb1 ensur proper cellular reaction differ ligand recruit distinct set erα cofactor ci regulatori element explain contradictori biolog greb1 breast growth respons estrogen antiestrogen refractori ezh2 depend repress greb1 trigger chromatin realloc erα coregul convert antiestrogen agonist clinic specimen patient receiv adjuv tamoxifen treatment ezh2 greb1 correl neg taken togeth better predict patient respons endocrin therapi overal work new strategi overcom endocrin resist metastat breast target particular epigenet program new strategi overcom endocrin resist metastat breast target particular epigenet program defin within 78 671 aacr,Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression
