Currently, there are four intrinsic molecular subtypes in breast cancer (BC): Luminal A, B, Her2-positive, and triple negative (TNBC). Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has revealed that Luminal subtypes have higher levels of genome-wide methylation that may be a result of Estrogen/Estrogen receptor α (E2/ERα) signaling pathway activation. In this study, we analyze promoter CpG-island (CGIs) of the <i>Reprimo (RPRM)</i> gene in breast cancers (<i>n</i> = 77), cell lines (<i>n</i> = 38), and normal breast tissue (<i>n</i> = 10) using a MBDCap-seq database. Then, a validation cohort (<i>n</i> = 26) was used to confirm the results found in the MBDCap-seq platform. A differential methylation pattern was found between BC and cell lines compared to normal breast tissue. In BC, a higher DNA methylation was observed in tissues that were ERα-positive than in ERα-negative ones; more precisely, subtypes Luminal A compared to TNBC. Also, significant reverse correlation was observed between DNA methylation and <i>RPRM</i> mRNA expression in BC. Our data suggest that ERα expression in BC may affect the DNA methylation of CGIs in the <i>RPRM</i> gene.

In this paper, we introduce two novel approaches to detect differentially interacting genomic regions between two Hi-C experiments using a network model. To make input data from multiple experiments comparable, we propose a normalization strategy guided by network topological properties. We then devise two measurements, using local and global connectivity information from the chromatin interaction networks, respectively, to assess the interaction differences between two experiments. When multiple replicates are present in experiments, our approaches provide the flexibility for users to either pool all replicates together to therefore increase the network coverage, or to use the replicates in parallel to increase the signal to noise ratio. We show that while the local method works better in detecting changes from simulated networks, the global method performs better on real Hi-C data. The local and global methods, regardless of pooling, are always superior to two existing methods. Furthermore, our methods work well on both unweighted and weighted networks and our normalization strategy significantly improves the performance compared with raw networks without normalization.

Here we discover that tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer is driven by a regulatory axis consisting of a master transcription factor, its cofactor, and an epigenetic regulator. The oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2 conferred tamoxifen resistance by silencing the expression of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) cofactor GREB1. In clinical specimens, induction of DNA methylation of a particular CpG-enriched region at the <i>GREB1</i> promoter negatively correlated with <i>GREB1</i> levels and cell sensitivity to endocrine agents. GREB1 also ensured proper cellular reactions to different ligands by recruiting distinct sets of ERα cofactors to <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, which explains the contradictory biological effects of GREB1 on breast cancer cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogen. In refractory cells, EZH2-dependent repression of GREB1 triggered chromatin reallocation of ERα coregulators, converting the antiestrogen into an agonist. In clinical specimens from patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, expression levels of EZH2 and GREB1 were correlated negatively, and taken together better predicted patient responses to endocrine therapy. Overall, our work suggests a new strategy to overcome endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer by targeting a particular epigenetic program.<b>Significance:</b> This study suggests a new strategy to overcome endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer by targeting a particular epigenetic program defined within. <i>Cancer Res; 78(3); 671-84. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"breast cancer, endocrine resistance, epigenetics","Animals|Apoptosis|Biomarkers, Tumor|Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinogenesis|Cell Proliferation|DNA Methylation|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism|Epigenesis, Genetic|Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology|Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics|Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism|Female|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Mice|Mice, Nude|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Prognosis|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tamoxifen/pharmacology|Transcription, Genetic|Tumor Cells, Cultured|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","Animals|Apoptosis|Biomarkers, Tumor|Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinogenesis|Cell Proliferation|DNA Methylation|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics|Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/metabolism|Epigenesis, Genetic|Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology|Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics|Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism|Female|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Mice|Mice, Nude|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Prognosis|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tamoxifen/pharmacology|Transcription, Genetic|Tumor Cells, Cultured|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",resist treatment driven epigenet reprogram specif transcriptom favor refractori phenotyp discov tamoxifen resist breast driven regulatori axi consist master transcript factor cofactor epigenet regul oncogen histon methyltransferas ezh2 confer tamoxifen resist silenc estrogen receptor α erα cofactor greb1 clinic specimen induct dna methyl particular cpg enrich region greb1 promot neg correl greb1 sensit endocrin agent greb1 ensur proper cellular reaction differ ligand recruit distinct set erα cofactor ci regulatori element explain contradictori biolog greb1 breast growth respons estrogen antiestrogen refractori ezh2 depend repress greb1 trigger chromatin realloc erα coregul convert antiestrogen agonist clinic specimen patient receiv adjuv tamoxifen treatment ezh2 greb1 correl neg taken togeth better predict patient respons endocrin therapi overal work new strategi overcom endocrin resist metastat breast target particular epigenet program new strategi overcom endocrin resist metastat breast target particular epigenet program defin within 78 671 aacr,Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression

In this study, we investigated this phenomenon by stratifying cell subpopulations based on transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated or untreated with androgen after cell-cycle synchronization. Model-based clustering of 397 differentially expressed genes identified eight potential subpopulations of LNCaP cells, revealing a previously unappreciable level of cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation displayed stem-like features with a slower cell doubling rate, increased sphere formation capability, and resistance to G<sub>2</sub>-M arrest induced by a mitosis inhibitor.

DNA methylation studies reveal that prepubertal BPA exposure alters signaling pathways that contribute to carcinogenesis. Prepubertal exposure to GEN and BPA + GEN revealed pathways involved in maintenance of cellular function, indicating that the presence of GEN either reduces or counters some of the alterations caused by the carcinogenic properties of BPA.

Both algorithms utilize a protein-protein interaction network and a random walk with a restart procedure to identify hidden relationships between an input gene set and pathways, but both use different randomization strategies to evaluate statistical significance and as a result emphasize different pathway properties. Compared to an over representation-based method, our algorithms can identify more statistically significant pathways. Compared to an existing network-based algorithm, EnrichNet, our algorithms have a higher sensitivity in revealing the true causal pathways while at the same time achieving a higher specificity.

Additionally, SRGAP2 and other genes in the Slit-Robo pathway have altered transcript levels in a subset of mouse and human osteosarcoma, and SRGAP2 protein expression is reduced or absent in a subset of primary tumor samples.

The mechanisms of this process are poorly understood, particularly in 3D, in part because of the lack of efficient methods to generate aligned collagen matrices. To address this technological gap, we propose a simple method to align collagen gels using guided cellular compaction. Our method yields highly aligned, acellular collagen constructs with predictable microstructural features, thus providing a controlled microenvironment for in vitro experiments. Quantifying cell behavior in these anisotropic constructs, we find that breast carcinoma cells are acutely sensitive to the direction and extent of collagen alignment. Further, live cell imaging and analysis of 3D cell migration reveals that alignment of collagen does not alter the total motility of breast cancer cells, but simply redirects their migration to produce largely one-dimensional movement. However, a profoundly enhanced motility in aligned collagen matrices is observed for the subpopulation of carcinoma cells with high tumor initiating and metastatic capacity, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analysis of the biophysical determinants of cell migration show that nuclear deformation is not a critical factor associated with the observed increases in motility for CSCs. Rather, smaller cell size, a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, and increased protrusive activity emerge as vital facilitators of rapid, contact-guided migration of CSCs in aligned 3D collagen matrices.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"breast carcinoma, migration, cell morphology, imaging","Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Collagen/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Humans|Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology|Phenotype","Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Collagen/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Humans|Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology|Phenotype",direct migrat contact guidanc align collagen extracellular matrix ecm critic enabl breast dissemin mechan process poorli understood particularli 3d part lack effici gener align collagen matric address technolog gap propos simpl align collagen gel guid cellular compact yield highli align acellular collagen construct predict microstructur featur thu provid control microenviron vitro experi quantifi behavior anisotrop construct find breast carcinoma acut sensit direct extent collagen align live imag 3d migrat reveal align collagen alter total motil breast simpli redirect migrat produc larg dimension movement profoundli enhanc motil align collagen matric subpopul carcinoma high initi metastat capac term stem csc biophys migrat nuclear deform critic factor motil csc rather smaller size high degre phenotyp plastic protrus emerg vital facilit rapid contact guid migrat csc align 3d collagen matrices.,Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics

We demonstrate that for single cells, aligned architectures providing contact guidance cues induce constrained focal adhesion maturation and associated F-actin alignment, consequently orchestrating anisotropic traction stresses that drive cell orientation and directional migration. Consistent with this understanding, relaxing spatial constraints to adhesion maturation either through reduction in substrate alignment density or reduction in adhesion size diminishes the contact guidance response. While such interactions allow single mesenchymal-like cells to spontaneously 'sense' and follow topographic alignment, intercellular interactions within epithelial clusters temper anisotropic cell-substratum forces, resulting in substantially lower directional response.

A key question is how fiber orientation and network geometry influence cell movement. Here we describe a quantitative, modeling-based approach toward identifying the mechanisms by which cells migrate in fibrous geometries having well controlled orientation. Specifically, U251 glioblastoma cells were seeded onto non-electrospinning Spinneret based tunable engineering parameters fiber substrates that consist of networks of suspended 400 nm diameter nanofibers. Cells were classified based on the local fiber geometry and cell migration dynamics observed by light microscopy. Cells were found in three distinct geometries: adhering two a single fiber, adhering to two parallel fibers, and adhering to a network of orthogonal fibers. Cells adhering to a single fiber or two parallel fibers can only move in one dimension along the fiber axis, whereas cells on a network of orthogonal fibers can move in two dimensions. We found that cells move faster and more persistently in 1D geometries than in 2D, with cell migration being faster on parallel fibers than on single fibers. To explain these behaviors mechanistically, we simulated cell migration in the three different geometries using a motor-clutch based model for cell traction forces. Using nearly identical parameter sets for each of the three cases, we found that the simulated cells naturally replicated the reduced migration in 2D relative to 1D geometries. In addition, the modestly faster 1D migration on parallel fibers relative to single fibers was captured using a correspondingly modest increase in the number of clutches to reflect increased surface area of adhesion on parallel fibers. Overall, the integrated modeling and experimental analysis shows that cell migration in response to varying fibrous geometries can be explained by a simple mechanical readout of geometry via a motor-clutch mechanism.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Adhesion|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Glioblastoma/pathology|Humans|Nanofibers/chemistry|Tumor Microenvironment","Cell Adhesion|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Glioblastoma/pathology|Humans|Nanofibers/chemistry|Tumor Microenvironment",understand migrat fibrou environ import wound heal immun function progress key question fiber orient network geometri influenc movement describ quantit model base approach toward mechan migrat fibrou geometri well control orient specif u251 glioblastoma seed onto non electrospin spinneret base tunabl engin paramet fiber substrat consist network suspend nm diamet nanofib classifi base local fiber geometri migrat dynam light microscopi three distinct geometri adher singl fiber adher parallel fiber adher network orthogon fiber adher singl fiber parallel fiber move dimens along fiber axi wherea network orthogon fiber move dimens move faster persist 1d geometri 2d migrat faster parallel fiber singl fiber explain behavior mechanist simul migrat three differ geometri motor clutch base model traction forc nearli ident paramet set three case simul natur replic reduc migrat 2d rel 1d geometri addit modestli faster 1d migrat parallel fiber rel singl fiber captur correspondingli modest number clutch reflect surfac area adhes parallel fiber overal integr model experiment migrat respons vari fibrou geometri explain simpl mechan readout geometri via motor clutch mechanism.,Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics

Here, we demonstrate imaging of doxorubicin intensity and lifetimes in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from mouse models of human cancer with multiphoton excitation and multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Multiphoton excitation imaging reveals robust doxorubicin emission in tissue sections and captures spatial heterogeneity in cells and tissues. However, quantifying the amount of doxorubicin signal in distinct cell compartments, particularly the nucleus, often remains challenging due to strong signals in multiple compartments. The addition of FLIM analysis to display the spatial distribution of excited state lifetimes clearly distinguishes between signals in distinct compartments such as the cell nuclei versus cytoplasm and allows for quantification of doxorubicin signal in each compartment. Furthermore, we observed a shift in lifetime values in the nuclei of transformed cells versus nontransformed cells, suggesting a possible diagnostic role for doxorubicin lifetime imaging to distinguish normal versus transformed cells.

Data show that invading mammary tumor cells, when cultured in a stiffened three-dimensional extracellular matrix that recapitulates the primary tumor stroma, adopt a basal-like phenotype. Metastatic tumor cells and basal-like tumor cells exert higher integrin-mediated traction forces at the bulk and molecular levels, consistent with a motor-clutch model in which motors and clutches are both increased. Basal-like nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells also display an altered integrin adhesion molecular organization at the nanoscale and recruit a suite of paxillin-associated proteins implicated in invasion and metastasis. Phosphorylation of paxillin by Src family kinases, which regulates adhesion turnover, is similarly enhanced in the metastatic and basal-like tumor cells, fostered by a stiff matrix, and critical for tumor cell invasion in our assays. Bioinformatics reveals an unappreciated relationship between Src kinases, paxillin, and survival of breast cancer patients.

Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose rupture spills genomic DNA into the cytosol.

Genetic suppression of chromosomal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner.

Correspondingly, TEV-treated ASCs were more contractile, secreted more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and promoted angiogenic sprouting of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These changes were dependent on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-related signaling and tumor cell glutaminase activity as their inhibition decreased TEV-related myofibroblastic differentiation of ASCs and related functional consequences. In summary, our data suggest that TEVs are important signaling factors that contribute to ASC desmoplastic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment, and suggest that tumor cell glutamine metabolism may be used as a therapeutic target to interfere with this process.",U54,,,"Breast, NOS",Breast Invasive Carcinoma,,,,,,,,microenvironment,,,,,"breast cancer, differentiation, angiogenesis, scanning electron microscopy","Actins/genetics|Actins/metabolism|Adipocytes/cytology|Adipocytes/drug effects|Adipocytes/metabolism|Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology|Benzophenanthridines/pharmacology|Biomarkers|Cell Culture Techniques|Cell Differentiation|Cell Line|Cell Line, Tumor|Cytokines/genetics|Cytokines/metabolism|Epithelial Cells/cytology|Epithelial Cells/drug effects|Epithelial Cells/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/chemistry|Extracellular Vesicles/chemistry|Female|Fibronectins|Gene Expression Regulation|Glutaminase/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutaminase/genetics|Glutaminase/metabolism|Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells|Humans|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/genetics|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/metabolism|Myofibroblasts/cytology|Myofibroblasts/drug effects|Myofibroblasts/metabolism|Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics|Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism|Neovascularization, Pathologic/pathology|Signal Transduction|Stem Cells/cytology|Stem Cells/drug effects|Stem Cells/metabolism|Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors|Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics|Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism","Actins/genetics|Actins/metabolism|Adipocytes/cytology|Adipocytes/drug effects|Adipocytes/metabolism|Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology|Benzophenanthridines/pharmacology|Biomarkers|Cell Culture Techniques|Cell Differentiation|Cell Line|Cell Line, Tumor|Cytokines/genetics|Cytokines/metabolism|Epithelial Cells/cytology|Epithelial Cells/drug effects|Epithelial Cells/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/chemistry|Extracellular Vesicles/chemistry|Female|Fibronectins|Gene Expression Regulation|Glutaminase/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutaminase/genetics|Glutaminase/metabolism|Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells|Humans|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/genetics|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/metabolism|Myofibroblasts/cytology|Myofibroblasts/drug effects|Myofibroblasts/metabolism|Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics|Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism|Neovascularization, Pathologic/pathology|Signal Transduction|Stem Cells/cytology|Stem Cells/drug effects|Stem Cells/metabolism|Transforming Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors|Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics|Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism",adipos deriv stem asc abundantli present mammari microenviron promot breast malign differenti myofibroblast remain larg unclear role deriv extracellular vesicl tev play process microfabr type collagen base tissu cultur platform investig breast deriv tev asc myofibroblast differenti consequenti chang extracellular matrix remodel vascular sprout tev collect mda mb human metastat breast mda promot asc myofibroblast differenti cultur indic alpha smooth muscl actin α sma fibronectin fn correspondingli tev treat asc contractil secret vascular endotheli growth factor vegf promot angiogen sprout human umbil vein endotheli huvec chang depend transform growth factor beta tgf β relat signal glutaminas inhibit decreas tev relat myofibroblast differenti asc relat function consequ summari tev import signal factor contribut asc desmoplast reprogram microenviron glutamin metabol therapeut target interfer process.,Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism

Importantly, collagen cross-linking requires fibronectin (FN). Fibrotic tumors contain abundant FN, and tumor cells frequently up-regulate the FN receptor α5β1 integrin. Using transgenic and xenograft models and tunable two- and three-dimensional substrates, we show that FN-bound α5β1 integrin promotes tension-dependent malignant transformation through engagement of the synergy site that enhances integrin adhesion force. We determined that ligation of the synergy site of FN permits tumor cells to engage a zyxin-stabilized, vinculin-linked scaffold that facilitates nucleation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate at the plasma membrane to enhance phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent tumor cell invasion.

Bone mineral is largely composed of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystals with physicochemical properties that vary significantly by anatomical location, age, and pathology. However, it remains unclear whether bone regions typically targeted by metastatic breast cancer feature distinct HA materials properties. Here we combined high-resolution X-ray scattering analysis with large-area Raman imaging, backscattered electron microscopy, histopathology, and microcomputed tomography to characterize HA in mouse models of advanced breast cancer in relevant skeletal locations. The proximal tibial metaphysis served as a common metastatic site in our studies; we identified that in disease-free bones this skeletal region contained smaller and less-oriented HA nanocrystals relative to ones that constitute the diaphysis. We further observed that osteolytic bone metastasis led to a decrease in HA nanocrystal size and perfection in remnant metaphyseal trabecular bone. Interestingly, in a model of localized breast cancer, metaphyseal HA nanocrystals were also smaller and less perfect than in corresponding bone in disease-free controls. Collectively, these results suggest that skeletal sites prone to tumor cell dissemination contain less-mature HA (i.e., smaller, less-perfect, and less-oriented crystals) and that primary tumors can further increase HA immaturity even before secondary tumor formation, mimicking alterations present during tibial metastasis.

We found that glioma aggression and patient prognosis correlate with HIF1α levels and the stiffness of a tenascin C (TNC)-enriched ECM.

In this study, we have compared two strategies for reducing nanoparticle accumulation in the liver, in order to investigate the specific contribution of Kupffer cells. Specifically, we have performed a comparison of the capability of pegylation and Kupffer cell depletion to reduce liposome accumulation in the liver. Pegylation reduces nanoparticle interactions with all types of cells and can serve as a control for elucidating the role of specific cell populations in liver accumulation. The results indicate that liposome pegylation is a more effective strategy for avoiding liver uptake compared to depletion of Kupffer cells, suggesting that nanoparticle interactions with other cells in the liver may also play a contributing role.

PDAC cells grown in variant culture conditions and exposed to extracellular lumican display typical characterizations of cancer cell in a quiescent state, such as growth inhibition, apoptosis, G0/G1 arrest and chemoresistance. Importantly, extracellular lumican is associated with diminished ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased p38 phosphorylation within PDAC cells. We further demonstrated that extracellular lumican physically binds with EGFR to trigger EGFR internalization and downregulation of EGFR and its downstream signal molecule ERK. Lumican enhances casitas B-lineage lymphoma expression, which stabilized the TGFβ Type II receptor sensitizing PDAC cells to TGFβ-mediated activation of p38 and SMAD signals.

We found that collagen-induced activation of DDR1 stimulated protumorigenic signaling through protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) and pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1) in pancreatic cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of DDR1 with an ATP-competitive orally available small-molecule kinase inhibitor (7rh) abrogated collagen-induced DDR1 signaling in pancreatic tumor cells and consequently reduced colony formation and migration. Furthermore, the inhibition of DDR1 with 7rh showed striking efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in orthotopic xenografts and autochthonous pancreatic tumors where it significantly reduced DDR1 activation and downstream signaling, reduced primary tumor burden, and improved chemoresponse.

We demonstrate here that an autocrine CCL5-CCR5 axis is a major regulator of immunosuppressive myeloid cells (IMC) of both monocytic and granulocytic lineages. The absence of the autocrine CCL5 abrogated the generation of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. In parallel, enhanced maturation of intratumoral neutrophils and macrophages occurred in spite of tumor-derived CCL5. The refractory nature of <i>ccl5</i>-null myeloid precursors to tumor-derived CCL5 was attributable to their persistent lack of membrane-bound CCR5. The changes in the <i>ccl5</i>-null myeloid compartment subsequently resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and decreased regulatory T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. An analysis of human triple-negative breast cancer specimens demonstrated an inverse correlation between ""immune CCR5"" levels and the maturation status of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils as well as 5-year-survival rates. Targeting the host CCL5 in bone marrow via nanoparticle-delivered expression silencing, in combination with the CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc, resulted in strong reductions of IMC and robust antitumor immunities.

Recent clinical studies on combination therapy of decitabine (DAC) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) have demonstrated synergy on MDS treatment, but the treatment can cause significant side effects to patients. In addition, both drugs have to be administered on a daily basis due to their short half-lives. In addressing key issues of reducing toxic side effects and improving pharmacokinetic profiles of the therapeutic agents, we have developed a new formulation by co-packaging DAC and ATO into alendronate-conjugated bone-targeting nanoparticles (BTNPs). Our pharmacokinetic studies revealed that intravenously administered BTNPs increased circulation time up to 3days. Biodistribution analysis showed that the BTNP facilitated DAC and ATO accumulation in the bone, which is 6.7 and 7.9 times more than untargeted NP.

As several chemotherapeutics are designed to target rapidly dividing cells, the presence of a low-proliferating cell population contributes significantly to treatment resistance. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that compressive stresses acting on tumor spheroids are able to hinder cell proliferation, through a mechanism of growth inhibition. However, studies analyzing the influence of mechanical compression on therapeutic treatment efficacy have still to be performed. In this work, we start from an existing mathematical model for avascular tumors, including the description of mechanical compression. We introduce governing equations for transport and uptake of a chemotherapeutic agent, acting on cell proliferation. Then, model equations are adapted for tumor spheroids and the combined effect of compressive stresses and drug action is investigated. Interestingly, we find that the variation in tumor spheroid volume, due to the presence of a drug targeting cell proliferation, considerably depends on the compressive stress level of the cell aggregate. Our results suggest that mechanical compression of tumors may compromise the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

The mass exchange from blood vessels to tissue and vice versa occurs through blood vessel walls. This vital process has been investigated experimentally over centuries, and also in the last decades by the use of computational methods. Due to geometrical and functional complexity and heterogeneity of capillary systems, it is however not feasible to model <i>in silico</i> individual capillaries (including transport through the walls and coupling to tissue) within whole organ models. Hence, there is a need for simplified and robust computational models that address mass transport in capillary-tissue systems. We here introduce a smeared modeling concept for gradient-driven mass transport and formulate a new composite smeared finite element (CSFE). The transport from capillary system is first smeared to continuous mass sources within tissue, under the assumption of uniform concentration within capillaries. Here, the fundamental relation between capillary surface area and volumetric fraction is derived as the basis for modeling transport through capillary walls. Further, we formulate the CSFE which relies on the transformation of the one-dimensional (1D) constitutive relations (for transport within capillaries) into the continuum form expressed by Darcy's and diffusion tensors. The introduced CSFE is composed of two volumetric parts - capillary and tissue domains, and has four nodal degrees of freedom (DOF): pressure and concentration for each of the two domains. The domains are coupled by connectivity elements at each node. The fictitious connectivity elements take into account the surface area of capillary walls which belongs to each node, as well as the wall material properties (permeability and partitioning). The overall FE model contains geometrical and material characteristics of the entire capillary-tissue system, with physiologically measurable parameters assigned to each FE node within the model. The smeared concept is implemented into our implicit-iterative FE scheme and into FE package PAK. The first three examples illustrate accuracy of the CSFE element, while the liver and pancreas models demonstrate robustness of the introduced methodology and its applicability to real physiological conditions.",U54,,,not reported,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,"biological tissue, capillary system, composite smeared finite element, convection, diffusion, partitioning, smeared model",,,key process live organ mass transport occur blood vessel tissu suppli tissu oxygen nutrient drug immun revers direct transport wast product metabol blood vessel mass exchang blood vessel tissu vice versa occur blood vessel wall vital process investig experiment centuri last decad comput due geometr function complex heterogen capillari system feasibl model silico individu capillari transport wall coupl tissu within whole organ model henc need simplifi robust comput model address mass transport capillari tissu system introduc smear model concept gradient driven mass transport formul new composit smear finit element csfe transport capillari system first smear continu mass sourc within tissu assumpt uniform concentr within capillari fundament relat capillari surfac area volumetr fraction deriv basi model transport capillari wall formul csfe reli transform dimension 1d constitut relat transport within capillari continuum form darci diffus tensor introduc csfe compos volumetr part capillari tissu domain four nodal degre freedom dof pressur concentr domain domain coupl connect element node fictiti connect element take account surfac area capillari wall belong node well wall materi properti permeabl partit overal fe model contain geometr materi characterist entir capillari tissu system physiolog measur paramet assign fe node within model smear concept implement implicit iter fe scheme fe packag pak first three exampl illustr accuraci csfe element liver pancrea model robust introduc methodolog applic real physiolog conditions.,The Center for Immunotherapeutic Transport Oncophysics

Yet, a conventional mRNA vaccine comprising of condensed mRNA molecules in a positively charged protein core structure is not effectively internalized by the antigen-presenting cells. It cannot offer sufficient protection for mRNA molecules from degradation by plasma and tissue enzymes either. Here, we have developed a lipopolyplex mRNA vaccine that consists of a poly-(β-amino ester) polymer mRNA core encapsulated into a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine/1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000 (EDOPC/DOPE/DSPE-PEG) lipid shell. This core-shell structured mRNA vaccine enters dendritic cells through macropinocytosis.

FDA approval of the immunotherapy-based drugs, sipuleucel-T (Provenge), ipilimumab (Yervoy, anti-CTLA-4), and more recently, the programmed cell death (PD)-1 antibody (pembrolizumab, Keytruda), for the treatment of multiple types of cancer has greatly advanced research and clinical studies in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, recent clinical trials, using NY-ESO-1-specific T cell receptor (TCR) or CD19-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), have shown promising clinical results for patients with metastatic cancer. Current success of cancer immunotherapy is built upon the work of cancer antigens and co-inhibitory signaling molecules identified 20 years ago. Among the large numbers of target antigens, CD19 is the best target for CAR T cell therapy for blood cancer, but CAR-engineered T cell immunotherapy does not yet work in solid cancer. NY-ESO-1 is one of the best targets for TCR-based immunotherapy in solid cancer. Despite the great success of checkpoint blockade therapy, more than 50% of cancer patients fail to respond to blockade therapy. The advent of new technologies such as next-generation sequencing has enhanced our ability to search for new immune targets in onco-immunology and accelerated the development of immunotherapy with potentially broader coverage of cancer patients.

Despite an extension of life expectancy associated with this treatment, resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-EGFR antibodies is almost inevitable. To identify additional signaling routes that can be cotargeted to overcome resistance, we quantified tumor-specific molecular changes that govern resistant cancer cell growth and survival. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics was used to profile <i>in vivo</i> signaling changes in 41 therapy-resistant tumors from four xenograft NSCLC models. We identified unique and tumor-specific tyrosine phosphorylation rewiring in tumors resistant to treatment with the irreversible third-generation EGFR-inhibitor, osimertinib, or the novel dual-targeting EGFR/Met antibody, JNJ-61186372. Tumor-specific increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides from EGFR family members, Shc1 and Gab1 or Src family kinase (SFK) substrates were observed, underscoring a differential ability of tumors to uniquely escape EGFR inhibition. Although most resistant tumors within each treatment group displayed a marked inhibition of EGFR as well as SFK signaling, the combination of EGFR inhibition (osimertinib) and SFK inhibition (saracatinib or dasatinib) led to further decrease in cell growth <i>in vitro</i> This result suggests that residual SFK signaling mediates therapeutic resistance and that elimination of this signal through combination therapy may delay onset of resistance. Overall, analysis of individual resistant tumors captured unique <i>in vivo</i> signaling rewiring that would have been masked by analysis of <i>in vitro</i> cell population averages. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 16(11); 2572-85. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NSCLC, mass spectrometry, xenograft, cell viability, (small-scale) drug screen","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics|Animals|Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage|Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects|Benzodioxoles/administration & dosage|Benzodioxoles/adverse effects|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors|ErbB Receptors/genetics|Humans|Mice|Mutation|Piperazines/administration & dosage|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/immunology|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics|Quinazolines/administration & dosage|Quinazolines/adverse effects|Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1/genetics|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays|src-Family Kinases/genetics","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics|Animals|Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage|Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects|Benzodioxoles/administration & dosage|Benzodioxoles/adverse effects|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors|ErbB Receptors/genetics|Humans|Mice|Mutation|Piperazines/administration & dosage|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/immunology|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/antagonists & inhibitors|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/genetics|Quinazolines/administration & dosage|Quinazolines/adverse effects|Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1/genetics|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays|src-Family Kinases/genetics",approxim non small lung nsclc patient unit state nsclc patient asia epiderm growth factor receptor egfr mutat elig receiv target anti egfr therapi despit extens life expect treatment resist egfr tyrosin kinas inhibitor anti egfr antibodi almost inevit addit signal rout cotarget overcom resist quantifi specif molecular chang govern resist growth surviv mass spectrometri base quantit proteom profil vivo signal chang therapi resist four xenograft nsclc model uniqu specif tyrosin phosphoryl rewir resist treatment irrevers third gener egfr inhibitor osimertinib novel dual target egfrmet antibodi jnj specif tyrosin phosphoryl peptid egfr famili member shc1 gab1 src famili kinas sfk substrat underscor differenti abil uniqu escap egfr inhibit although resist within treatment group display mark inhibit egfr well sfk signal combin egfr inhibit osimertinib sfk inhibit saracatinib dasatinib led decreas growth vitro residu sfk signal mediat therapeut resist elimin signal combin therapi delay onset resist overal individu resist captur uniqu vivo signal rewir would mask vitro popul averag mol ther 16 2572 aacr,MIT Mayo Physical Sciences Center for Drug Distribution and Drug Efficacy in Brain Tumors

The recent approval of several molecularly-targeted agents (e.g., BRAF, MEK inhibitors) and biologics (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) has brought new hope to patients suffering from this formerly untreatable and lethal disease. Importantly, there have been recent reports of success in some clinical studies examining the efficacy of both targeted agents and immunotherapies that show similar response rates in both brain metastases and extracranial disease. While these studies are encouraging, there remains significant room for improvement in the treatment of MBM, given the lack of durable response and the development of resistance to current therapies. Critical questions remain regarding mechanisms that lead to this lack of durable response and development of resistance, and how those mechanisms may differ in systemic sites versus brain metastases. One issue that may not be fully appreciated is that the delivery of several small molecule molecularly-targeted therapies to the brain is often restricted due to active efflux at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface. Inadequate local drug concentrations may be partially responsible for the development of unique patterns of resistance at metastatic sites in the brain. It is clear that there can be local, heterogeneous BBB breakdown in MBM, as exemplified by contrast-enhancement on T1-weighted MR imaging. However, it is possible that the successful treatment of MBM with small molecule targeted therapies will depend, in part, on the ability of these therapies to penetrate an intact BBB and reach the protected micro-metastases (so called ""sub-clinical"" disease) that escape early detection by contrast-enhanced MRI, as well as regions of tumor within MRI-detectable metastases that may have a less compromised BBB. The emergence of resistance in MBM may be related to several diverse, yet interrelated, factors including the distinct microenvironment of the brain and inadequate brain penetration of targeted therapies to specific regions of tumor. The tumor microenvironment has been ascribed to play a key role in steering the course of disease progression, by dictating changes in expression of tumor drivers and resistance-related signaling mechanisms. Therefore, a key issue to consider is how changes in drug delivery, and hence local drug concentrations within a metastatic microenvironment, will influence the development of resistance.

CAFs are thought to be more mechanically active but how this trait may alter the tumor microenvironment is poorly understood. We hypothesized that enhanced mechanical activity of CAFs, as regulated by the Rho/ROCK pathway, contributes to increased blood vessel growth. Using a 3D in vitro tissue model of vasculogenesis, we observed increased vascularization in the presence of breast cancer CAFs compared to normal breast fibroblasts. Further studies indicated this phenomenon was not simply a result of enhanced soluble signaling factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and that CAFs generated significantly larger deformations in 3D gels compared to normal fibroblasts. Inhibition of the mechanotransductive pathways abrogated the ability of CAFs to deform the matrix and suppressed vascularization. Finally, utilizing magnetic microbeads to mechanically stimulate mechanically-inhibited CAFs showed partial rescue of vascularization.

We previously reported that overexpression of 14-3-3γ caused the appearance of polyploid cells, a phenotype demonstrated to have profound tumor promoting properties. Here we examined the mechanism driving 14-3-3γ-induced polyploidization and the effect this has on genomic stability. Using FUCCI probes we showed that these polyploid cells appeared when diploid cells failed to enter mitosis and subsequently underwent endoreduplication. We then demonstrated that 14-3-3γ-induced polyploid cells experience significant chromosomal segregation errors during mitosis and observed that some of these cells stably propagate as tetraploids when isolated cells were expanded into stable cultures. These data lead us to conclude that overexpression of the 14-3-3γ promotes endoreduplication. We further investigated the role of 14-3-3γ in human NSCLC samples and found that its expression is significantly elevated in polyploid tumors.

Non-muscle myosin II (NMII) functions at the interface between contractility, adhesion and signal transduction. It is therefore a plausible regulator of mammary morphogenesis. We tested the genetic requirement for NMIIA and NMIIB in mammary morphogenesis through deletion of the three NMII heavy chain-encoding genes (<i>NMHCIIA</i>, <i>NMHCIIB</i> and <i>NMHCIIC</i>; also known as <i>MYH9</i>, <i>MYH10</i> and <i>MYH14</i>, respectively) that confer specificity to the complex. Surprisingly, mosaic loss, but not ubiquitous loss, of <i>NMHCIIA</i> and <i>NMHCIIB</i> induced high levels of proliferation in 3D culture. This phenotype was observed even when cells were cultured in basal medium, which does not support tissue level growth of wild-type epithelium. Mosaic loss of NMIIA and NMIIB combined with FGF signaling to induce hyperplasia.

Recent work has examined the physics and biochemistry that coordinates the motions of these groups of cells. Of late, two mechanisms have been touted as being crucial to the physics of these systems: leader cells and jamming. However, the actual importance of these to collective migration remains circumstantial. Fundamentally, collective behavior must arise from the actions of individual cells. Here, we show how biophysical activity of an isolated cell impacts collective dynamics in epithelial layers. Although many reports suggest that wound closure rates depend on isolated cell speed and/or leader cells, we find that these correlations are not universally true, nor do collective dynamics follow the trends suggested by models for jamming. Instead, our experimental data, when coupled with a mathematical model for collective migration, shows that intracellular contractile stress, isolated cell speed, and adhesion all play a substantial role in influencing epithelial dynamics, and that alterations in contraction and/or substrate adhesion can cause confluent epithelial monolayers to exhibit an increase in motility, a feature reminiscent of cancer metastasis. These results directly question the validity of wound-healing assays as a general means for measuring cell migration, and provide further insight into the salient physics of collective migration.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"mathematical modeling, motility","Animals|Biomechanical Phenomena|Cell Adhesion|Cell Movement/physiology|Computer Simulation|Dogs|Epithelial Cells/cytology|Epithelial Cells/physiology|Intracellular Space/physiology|Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells|Microscopy|Models, Biological|Wound Healing/physiology","Animals|Biomechanical Phenomena|Cell Adhesion|Cell Movement/physiology|Computer Simulation|Dogs|Epithelial Cells/cytology|Epithelial Cells/physiology|Intracellular Space/physiology|Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells|Microscopy|Models, Biological|Wound Healing/physiology",singl isol epitheli move randomli wound heal organ metastasi mani multicellular phenomena motil group collect migrat persist direct manner recent work examin physic biochemistri coordin motion group late mechan tout crucial physic system leader jam actual import collect migrat remain circumstanti fundament collect behavior must aris action individu biophys isol impact collect dynam epitheli layer although mani wound closur rate depend isol speed andor leader find correl univers true collect dynam follow trend model jam instead experiment coupl mathemat model collect migrat intracellular contractil stress isol speed adhes play substanti role influenc epitheli dynam alter contract andor substrat adhes caus confluent epitheli monolay exhibit motil featur reminisc metastasi directli question valid wound heal assay gener mean measur migrat provid insight salient physic collect migration.,Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences Oncology Center (PS-OC)

Although the influence of matrix stiffness on cellular mechanosensitivity and motility are well-recognized, it remains unknown whether these matrix-dependent cellular features persist after cells move to a new microenvironment. Here, we interrogate whether priming of epithelial cells by a given matrix stiffness influences their future collective migration on a different matrix - a property we refer to as the 'mechanical memory' of migratory cells. To prime cells on a defined matrix and track their collective migration onto an adjoining secondary matrix of dissimilar stiffness, we develop a modular polyacrylamide substrate through step-by-step polymerization of different PA compositions. We report that epithelial cells primed on a stiff matrix migrate faster, display higher actomyosin expression, form larger focal adhesions, and retain nuclear YAP even after arriving onto a soft secondary matrix, as compared to their control behavior on a homogeneously soft matrix. Priming on a soft ECM causes a reverse effect. The depletion of YAP dramatically reduces this memory-dependent migration.

The gatekeeper site residue mutation, T790M accounts for around 60% of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. The first generation EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib, and the second generation inhibitor, afatinib are FDA approved for initial treatment of EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma. The predominant biomarker of EGFR TKI responsiveness is the presence of <i>EGFR</i> TKI-sensitizing mutations. However, 30-40% of patients with <i>EGFR</i> mutations exhibit primary resistance to these TKIs, underscoring the unmet need of identifying additional biomarkers of treatment response. Here, we sought to characterize the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGFR TKI treatment of mutant EGFR-driven human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with varying sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and afatinib. We employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify and quantify tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. The proportion of tyrosine phosphorylated sites that had reduced phosphorylation upon erlotinib or afatinib treatment correlated with the degree of TKI-sensitivity. Afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, more effectively inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of a majority of the substrates. The phosphosites with phosphorylation SILAC ratios that correlated with the TKI-sensitivity of the cell lines include sites on kinases, such as EGFR-Y1197 and MAPK7-Y221, and adaptor proteins, such as SHC1-Y349/350, ERRFI1-Y394, GAB1-Y689, STAT5A-Y694, DLG3-Y705, and DAPP1-Y139, suggesting these are potential biomarkers of TKI sensitivity. DAPP1, is a novel target of mutant EGFR signaling and Y-139 is the major site of DAPP1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also uncovered several off-target effects of these TKIs, such as MST1R-Y1238/Y1239 and MET-Y1252/1253.

Here, we provide novel insights into treatment response for the antiandrogen abiraterone by analyses of a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with combined inactivation of <i>Trp53</i> and <i>Pten</i>, which are frequently comutated in human CRPC. These NPp53 mice fail to respond to abiraterone and display accelerated progression to tumors resembling treatment-related CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) in humans. Cross-species computational analyses identify master regulators of adverse response that are conserved with human CRPC-NE, including the neural differentiation factor <i>SOX11</i>, which promotes neuroendocrine differentiation in cells derived from NPp53 tumors. Furthermore, abiraterone-treated NPp53 prostate tumors contain regions of focal and/or overt neuroendocrine differentiation, distinguished by their proliferative potential. Notably, lineage tracing <i>in vivo</i> provides definitive and quantitative evidence that focal and overt neuroendocrine regions arise by transdifferentiation of luminal adenocarcinoma cells.

Based on the tremendous success of immunotherapeutic approaches, we sought to investigate such approaches in a case of metastatic rectal NET. Here, we apply an integrative approach using various computational and experimental methods to explore several aspects of the tumor-host immune interactions for immunotherapeutic options. Sequencing of six different liver metastases revealed a quite homogenous set of mutations, and further analysis of these mutations for immunogenicity revealed few neo-epitopes with pre-existing T cell reactivity, which can be used in therapeutic vaccines. Staining for immunomodulatory proteins and cytokine profiling showed that the immune setting is surprisingly different, when compared to liver metastases of colorectal cancer for instance.

Although these aggressive traits have been associated with phenotypic heterogeneity, our understanding of this association remains incomplete. To fill this knowledge gap, we inferred a set of 33 transcription factors (TF) associated with gene signatures of the known neuroendocrine/epithelial (NE) and non-neuroendocrine/mesenchymal-like (ML) SCLC phenotypes. The topology of this SCLC TF network was derived from prior knowledge and was simulated using Boolean modeling. These simulations predicted that the network settles into attractors, or TF expression patterns, that correlate with NE or ML phenotypes, suggesting that TF network dynamics underlie the emergence of heterogeneous SCLC phenotypes. However, several cell lines and patient tumor specimens failed to correlate with either the NE or ML attractors. By flow cytometry, single cells within these cell lines simultaneously expressed surface markers of both NE and ML differentiation, confirming the existence of a ""hybrid"" phenotype. Upon exposure to standard-of-care cytotoxic drugs or epigenetic modifiers, NE and ML cell populations converged toward the hybrid state, suggesting possible escape from treatment. Our findings indicate that SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity can be specified dynamically by attractor states of a master regulatory TF network. Thus, SCLC heterogeneity may be best understood as states within an epigenetic landscape.

Besides hydrogen bonding in the major groove (base readout), proteins recognize minor-groove geometry using positively charged amino acids (shape readout). The underlying mechanism of DNA shape readout involves the correlation between minor-groove width and electrostatic potential (EP). To probe this biophysical effect directly, rather than using minor-groove width as an indirect measure for shape readout, we developed a methodology, DNAphi, for predicting EP in the minor groove and confirmed the direct role of EP in protein-DNA binding using massive sequencing data. The DNAphi method uses a sliding-window approach to mine results from non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations on DNA structures derived from all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. We validated this approach, which only requires nucleotide sequence as input, based on direct comparison with NLPB calculations for available crystal structures. Using statistical machine-learning approaches, we showed that adding EP as a biophysical feature can improve the predictive power of quantitative binding specificity models across 27 transcription factor families.

However, it is not clear whether these polarity patterns can be explained by the same underlying regulatory mechanism. Here, we show that random, persistent, and oscillatory migration accompanied by polarization can simultaneously occur in populations of melanoma cells derived from tumors with different degrees of aggressiveness. We demonstrate that all of these patterns and the probabilities of their occurrence are quantitatively accounted for by a simple mechanism involving a spatially distributed, mechanochemical feedback coupling the dynamically changing extracellular matrix (ECM)-cell contacts to the activation of signaling downstream of the Rho-family small GTPases.

Early metastases were associated with dense networks of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>low</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> dendritic cells (DC), which developed from monocytes in response to tumor-released GM-CSF.

Moreover, blocking PD-L2 selectively activated CD8 T cells at secondary sites and suppressed metastasis, suggesting that the DCs use this particular pathway to inhibit CD8 T-cell-mediated tumor immunity. Phenotypically similar DCs accumulated at primary and secondary sites in other models and in human PDAC. These studies suggest that a discrete DC subset both expands Tregs and suppresses CD8 T cells to establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to metastasis formation.

Similarly, 19p13.3 variants were associated with a 4-fold increased likelihood of somatic mutations in <i>PTEN.</i> In support of this association, we found that <i>PTEN</i> knockdown sensitizes the <i>MTOR</i> pathway to high expression of the 19p13.3 gene <i>GNA11</i> Finally, we observed that stratifying patients by germline polymorphisms exposed distinct somatic mutation landscapes, implicating new cancer genes. This study creates a validated resource of inherited variants that govern where and how cancer develops, opening avenues for prevention research.<b>Significance:</b> This study systematically identifies germline variants that directly affect tumor evolution, either by dramatically increasing alteration frequency of specific cancer genes or by influencing the site where a tumor develops. <i>Cancer Discovery; 7(4); 410-23. ©2017 AACR.</i><i>See related commentary by Geeleher and Huang, p. 354</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 339</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"tumor evolution, genetic interactions","GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Genome, Human|Genomics|Germ-Line Mutation/genetics|Humans|Neoplasms/genetics|Neoplasms/pathology|PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics|Phosphoproteins/genetics|Polymorphism, Genetic|RNA Splicing/genetics|RNA Splicing Factors/genetics|TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics","GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Genome, Human|Genomics|Germ-Line Mutation/genetics|Humans|Neoplasms/genetics|Neoplasms/pathology|PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics|Phosphoproteins/genetics|Polymorphism, Genetic|RNA Splicing/genetics|RNA Splicing Factors/genetics|TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics",recent character extens somat alter aris somat evolut significantli affect inherit polymorph carri germlin analyz genom reveal systemat valid genet interact germlin polymorph major somat event format specif tissu alter specif among germlin somat interact germlin variant rbfox1 incid sf3b1 somat mutat fold via function alter rna splice similarli 19p13 variant fold likelihood somat mutat pten support pten knockdown sensit mtor pathway high 19p13 gna11 final stratifi patient germlin polymorph expos distinct somat mutat landscap implic new creat valid resourc inherit variant govern open avenu prevent research systemat germlin variant directli affect evolut either dramat alter frequenc specif influenc site discoveri 7 410 aacr see relat commentari geeleh huang p 354 articl highlight issu featur p 339,The Cancer Cell Map Initiative

However, the efficacy of these drugs can be hampered by the physical attributes of the tumor tissue, such as tortuous vasculature, dense and fibrous extracellular matrix, irregular cellular architecture, tumor metabolic gradients, and non-uniform expression of the cell membrane receptors. This can impede the transport of therapeutic agents to tumor cells in sufficient quantities. In addition, tumor microenvironments undergo dynamic spatio-temporal changes during tumor progression and treatment, which can also obstruct drug efficacy. To examine ways to improve drug delivery on a cell-to-tissue scale (single-cell pharmacology), we developed the microscale pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (microPKPD) modeling framework. Our model is modular and can be adjusted to include only the mathematical equations that are crucial for a biological problem under consideration. This modularity makes the model applicable to a broad range of pharmacological cases. As an illustration, we present two specific applications of the microPKPD methodology that help to identify optimal drug properties. The hypoxia-activated drugs example uses continuous drug concentrations, diffusive-advective transport through the tumor interstitium, and passive transmembrane drug uptake. The targeted therapy example represents drug molecules as discrete particles that move by diffusion and actively bind to cell receptors. The proposed modeling approach takes into account the explicit tumor tissue morphology, its metabolic landscape and/or specific receptor distribution. All these tumor attributes can be assessed from patients' diagnostic biopsies; thus, the proposed methodology can be developed into a tool suitable for personalized medicine, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",U54,,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,system chemotherapi main anticanc treatment kind clinic diagnos efficaci drug hamper physic attribut tissu tortuou vasculatur dens fibrou extracellular matrix irregular cellular architectur metabol gradient non uniform membran receptor imped transport therapeut agent suffici quantiti addit microenviron undergo dynam spatio tempor chang progress treatment obstruct drug efficaci examin way improv drug deliveri tissu scale singl pharmacolog microscal pharmacokineticspharmacodynam micropkpd model framework model modular adjust mathemat equat crucial biolog problem consider modular make model applic broad rang pharmacolog case illustr present specif applic micropkpd methodolog help optim drug properti hypoxia drug exampl continu drug concentr diffus advect transport interstitium passiv transmembran drug uptak target therapi exampl repres drug molecul discret particl move diffus bind receptor propos model approach take account explicit tissu morpholog metabol landscap andor specif receptor distribut attribut patient diagnost biopsi thu propos methodolog tool suitabl person medicin neoadjuv chemotherapy.,H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute

We use simple chemical reaction networks to implement stochastic switches that map gene products to phenotypes, and investigate the impact of structurally distinct mappings on the evolution of phenotypic heterogeneity. Bet-hedging naturally emerges within this model, and is robust to evolutionary loss through mutations to both the expression of individual genes, and to the network itself. This robustness explains an apparent paradox of bet-hedging-why does it persist in environments where natural selection necessarily acts to remove it? The structure of the underlying molecular mechanism, itself subject to selection, can slow the evolutionary loss of bet-hedging to ensure a survival mechanism against environmental catastrophes even when they are rare.

We have recently shown that OS is characterized by interstitial acidosis, a microenvironmental condition that is similar to a wound setting, in which mesenchymal reactive cells are activated to release mitogenic and chemotactic factors. We therefore intended to test the hypothesis that, in OS, acid-activated MSC influence tumor cell behavior. Conditioned media or co-culture with normal MSC previously incubated with short-term acidosis (pH 6.8 for 10 hr, H<sup>+</sup> -MSC) enhanced OS clonogenicity and invasion. This effect was mediated by NF-κB pathway activation. In fact, deep-sequencing analysis, confirmed by Real-Time PCR and ELISA, demonstrated that H<sup>+</sup> -MSC differentially induced a tissue remodeling phenotype with increased expression of RelA, RelB and NF-κB1, and downstream, of CSF2/GM-CSF, CSF3/G-CSF and BMP2 colony-promoting factors, and of chemokines (CCL5, CXCL5 and CXCL1), and cytokines (IL6 and IL8), with an increased expression of CXCR4. An increased expression of IL6 and IL8 were found only in normal stromal cells, but not in OS cells, and this was confirmed in tumor-associated stromal cells isolated from OS tissue. Finally, H<sup>+</sup> -MSC conditioned medium differentially promoted OS stemness (sarcosphere number, stem-associated gene expression), and chemoresistance also via IL6 secretion. Our data support the hypothesis that the acidic OS microenvironment is a key factor for MSC activation, in turn promoting the secretion of paracrine factors that influence tumor behavior, a mechanism that holds the potential for future therapeutic interventions aimed to target OS.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animals|Bone Neoplasms/pathology|Bone Neoplasms/veterinary|Cell Line, Tumor|Coculture Techniques|Culture Media, Conditioned|Cytokines/biosynthesis|Cytokines/genetics|Cytokines/metabolism|Dog Diseases/pathology|Dogs|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Hydrogen-Ion Concentration|Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology|Mice|NF-kappa B/metabolism|Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism|Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology|Osteosarcoma/pathology|Osteosarcoma/veterinary|Paracrine Communication|RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis|RNA, Messenger/genetics|RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis|RNA, Neoplasm/genetics|Signal Transduction|Stromal Cells/physiology|Tumor Microenvironment","Animals|Bone Neoplasms/pathology|Bone Neoplasms/veterinary|Cell Line, Tumor|Coculture Techniques|Culture Media, Conditioned|Cytokines/biosynthesis|Cytokines/genetics|Cytokines/metabolism|Dog Diseases/pathology|Dogs|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Humans|Hydrogen-Ion Concentration|Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology|Mice|NF-kappa B/metabolism|Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism|Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology|Osteosarcoma/pathology|Osteosarcoma/veterinary|Paracrine Communication|RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis|RNA, Messenger/genetics|RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis|RNA, Neoplasm/genetics|Signal Transduction|Stromal Cells/physiology|Tumor Microenvironment",role mesenchym stem msc osteosarcoma os common primari bone extens elucid recent os character interstiti acidosi microenvironment condit similar wound set mesenchym reactiv releas mitogen chemotact factor therefor intend test hypothesi os acid msc influenc behavior condit media co cultur normal msc previous incub short term acidosi ph hr h msc enhanc os clonogen invas mediat nf κb pathway fact deep sequenc confirm real time pcr elisa h msc differenti induc tissu remodel phenotyp rela relb nf κb1 downstream csf2gm csf csf3g csf bmp2 coloni promot factor chemokin ccl5 cxcl5 cxcl1 cytokin il6 il8 cxcr4 il6 il8 normal stromal os confirm stromal isol os tissu final h msc condit medium differenti promot os stem sarcospher number stem chemoresist via il6 secret support hypothesi acid os microenviron key factor msc turn promot secret paracrin factor influenc behavior mechan hold futur therapeut intervent aim target os.,H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute

However, this concept rests on the implicit assumption that cancer cells never evolve to a fitness maximum because they can always acquire mutations that increase proliferative capacity. In this study, we investigated the validity of this assumption. Using evolutionary game theory, we demonstrate that local cancer cell populations will rapidly converge to the fittest phenotype given a stable environment. In such settings, cellular spatial heterogeneity in a tumor will be largely governed by regional variations in environmental conditions, for example, alterations in blood flow. Model simulations specifically predict a common spatial pattern in which cancer cells at the tumor-host interface exhibit invasion-promoting, rapidly proliferating phenotypic properties, whereas cells in the tumor core maximize their population density by promoting supportive tissue infrastructures, for example, to promote angiogenesis. We tested model predictions through detailed quantitative image analysis of phenotypic spatial distribution in histologic sections of 10 patients with stage 2 invasive breast cancers. CAIX, GLUT1, and Ki67 were upregulated in the tumor edge, consistent with an acid-producing invasive, proliferative phenotype. Cells in the tumor core were 20% denser than the edge, exhibiting upregulation of CAXII, HIF-1Î±, and cleaved caspase-3, consistent with a more static and less proliferative phenotype. Similarly, vascularity was consistently lower in the tumor center compared with the tumor edges. Lymphocytic immune responses to tumor antigens also trended to higher level in the tumor edge, although this effect did not reach statistical significance. Like invasive species in nature, cancer cells at the leading edge of the tumor possess a different phenotype from cells in the tumor core. Our results suggest that at least some of the molecular heterogeneity in cancer cells in tumors is governed by predictable regional variations in environmental selection forces, arguing against the assumption that cancer cells can evolve toward a local fitness maximum by random accumulation of mutations.

We treated MDA-MB-231/luc triple-negative and MCF7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancers growing orthotopically in a mouse mammary fat pad with paclitaxel, using algorithms linked to tumor response monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. We found that initial control required more intensive therapy with regular application of drug to deflect the exponential tumor growth curve onto a plateau. Dose-skipping algorithms during this phase were less successful than variable dosing algorithms. However, once initial tumor control was achieved, it was maintained with progressively smaller drug doses. In 60 to 80% of animals, continued decline in tumor size permitted intervals as long as several weeks in which no treatment was necessary. Magnetic resonance images and histological analysis of tumors controlled by adaptive therapy demonstrated increased vascular density and less necrosis, suggesting that vascular normalization resulting from enforced stabilization of tumor volume may contribute to ongoing tumor control with lower drug doses.

MTI-101 is a first-in-class peptidomimetic that binds a CD44/ITGA4 containing complex and triggers necrotic cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines. In this report, we show that acquisition of resistance to MTI-101 correlates with changes in expression of genes predicted to attenuate Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Consistent with the acquired resistant genotype, MTI-101 treatment induces a rapid and robust increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the parental cells; a finding that was attenuated in the acquired drug resistant cell line. Mechanistically, we show that pharmacological inhibition of store operated channels or reduction in the expression of a component of the store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, TRPC1 blocks MTI-101 induced cell death.

This theoretical model, however, neglects fundamental conditions for evolution by natural selection, which include competition for survival and a local environmental context. Recent observations that the mutational burden in different cancers can vary by 2 orders of magnitude and that multiple mutations, some of which are ""oncogenic,"" are observed in normal tissue suggests these neglected Darwinian dynamics may play a critical role in modifying the evolutionary consequences of molecular events. Here we discuss evolutionary principles in normal tissue focusing on the dynamical tension between different evolutionary levels of selection. Normal somatic cells within metazoans do not ordinarily evolve because their survival and proliferation are governed by tissue signals and internal controls (e.g. telomere shortening) that maintain homeostatic function. The fitness of each cell is, thus, identical to the whole organism, which is the evolutionary level of selection. For a cell to evolve, it must acquire a self-defined fitness function so that its survival and proliferation is determined entirely by its own heritable phenotypic properties. Cells can develop independence from normal tissue control through randomly accumulating mutations that disrupt its ability to recognize or respond to all host signals. A self-defined fitness function can also be gained non-genetically when tissue control signals are lost due to injury, inflammation, or infection. Accumulating mutations in cells without a self-defined fitness function will produce no evolution - consistent with reports showing mutations, including some that would ordinarily be oncogenic, are present in cells from normal tissue. Furthermore, once evolution begins, Darwinian forces will promote mutations that increase fitness and eliminate those that do not. Thus, cancer cells will typically have a mutational burden similar to adjacent normal cells and many (perhaps most) mutations observed in cancer cells occurred prior to somatic evolution and may not contribute to the cell's malignant phenotype.

We have developed a system, <i>Ex vivo</i> Mathematical Myeloma Advisor (EMMA), consisting of patient-specific mathematical models parameterized by an <i>ex vivo</i> assay that reverse engineers the intensity and heterogeneity of chemosensitivity of primary cells from multiple myeloma patients, allowing us to predict clinical response to up to 31 drugs within 5 days after bone marrow biopsy. From a cohort of 52 multiple myeloma patients, EMMA correctly classified 96% as responders/nonresponders and correctly classified 79% according to International Myeloma Working Group stratification of level of response. We also observed a significant correlation between predicted and actual tumor burden measurements (Pearson <i>r</i> = 0.5658, <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Preliminary estimates indicate that, among the patients enrolled in this study, 60% were treated with at least one ineffective agent from their therapy combination regimen, whereas 30% would have responded better if treated with another available drug or combination. Two <i>in silico</i> clinical trials with experimental agents ricolinostat and venetoclax, in a cohort of 19 multiple myeloma patient samples, yielded consistent results with recent phase I/II trials, suggesting that EMMA is a feasible platform for estimating clinical efficacy of drugs and inclusion criteria screening. This unique platform, specifically designed to predict therapeutic response in multiple myeloma patients within a clinically actionable time frame, has shown high predictive accuracy in patients treated with combinations of different classes of drugs.

IFNγ release blocked by acidic pH did not occur at the level of steady-state mRNA, implying that the effect of acidity was posttranslational. Acidification did not affect cytoplasmic pH, suggesting that signals transduced by external acidity were likely mediated by specific acid-sensing receptors, four of which are expressed by T cells. Notably, neutralizing tumor acidity with bicarbonate monotherapy impaired the growth of some cancer types in mice where it was associated with increased T-cell infiltration.

In three spontaneous murine cancers (prostate cancers in TRAMP and PTEN mice, pancreatic cancer in KPC mice), we identified two subpopulations with distinct niche construction adaptive strategies that remained stable in culture: (i) invasive cells that produce an acidic environment via upregulated aerobic glycolysis; and (ii) noninvasive cells that were angiogenic and metabolically near-normal. Darwinian interactions of these subpopulations were investigated in TRAMP prostate cancers. Computer simulations demonstrated invasive, acid-producing (C2) cells maintain a fitness advantage over noninvasive, angiogenic (C3) cells by promoting invasion and reducing efficacy of immune response. Immunohistochemical analysis of untreated tumors confirmed that C2 cells were invariably more abundant than C3 cells. However, the C2 adaptive strategy phenotype incurred a significant cost due to inefficient energy production (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) and depletion of resources for adaptations to an acidic environment. Mathematical model simulations predicted that small perturbations of the microenvironmental extracellular pH (pHe) could invert the cost/benefit ratio of the C2 strategy and select for C3 cells. <i>In vivo</i>, 200 mmol/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub> added to the drinking water of 4-week-old TRAMP mice increased the intraprostatic pHe by 0.2 units and promoted proliferation of noninvasive C3 cells, which remained confined within the ducts so that primary cancer did not develop. A 0.2 pHe increase in established tumors increased the fraction of C3 cells and signficantly diminished growth of primary and metastatic tumors. In an experimental tumor construct, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were coinjected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. C2-like MDA-MB-231 cells dominated in untreated animals, but C3-like MCF7 cells were selected and tumor growth slowed when intratumoral pHe was increased. Overall, our data support the use of mathematical modeling of intratumoral Darwinian interactions of environmental selection forces and cancer cell adaptive strategies. These models allow the tumor to be steered into a less invasive pathway through the application of small but selective biological force. <i>Cancer Res; 77(9); 2242-54. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animals|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Lineage/genetics|Cell Proliferation/genetics|Computer Simulation|Evolution, Molecular|Female|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Male|Mice|Models, Theoretical|PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics|Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics|Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology|Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics|Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25/genetics|Selection, Genetic/genetics|Tumor Microenvironment|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","Animals|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Lineage/genetics|Cell Proliferation/genetics|Computer Simulation|Evolution, Molecular|Female|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Male|Mice|Models, Theoretical|PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics|Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics|Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology|Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics|Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 25/genetics|Selection, Genetic/genetics|Tumor Microenvironment|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",ongo intratumor evolut appar molecular variat among differ region genet alon provid littl insight environment select forc cellular phenotyp adapt govern underli darwinian dynam three spontan murin prostat tramp pten mice pancreat kpc mice subpopul distinct nich construct adapt strategi remain stabl cultur (i invas produc acid environ via upregul aerob glycolysi ii noninvas angiogen metabol near normal darwinian interact subpopul investig tramp prostat comput simul invas acid produc c2 maintain fit advantag noninvas angiogen c3 promot invas reduc efficaci immun respons immunohistochem untreat confirm c2 invari abund c3 c2 adapt strategi phenotyp incur cost due ineffici energi product i.e aerob glycolysi deplet resourc adapt acid environ mathemat model simul predict small perturb microenvironment extracellular ph phe could invert costbenefit ratio c2 strategi select c3 vivo 200 mmoll nahco ad drink water week old tramp mice intraprostat phe unit promot prolifer noninvas c3 remain confin within duct primari phe establish fraction c3 signficantli diminish growth primari metastat experiment construct mcf7 mda mb breast coinject mammari fat pad scid mice c2 like mda mb domin untreat anim c3 like mcf7 select growth slow intratumor phe overal support mathemat model intratumor darwinian interact environment select forc adapt strategi model allow steer less invas pathway applic small select biolog forc 77 2242 aacr,H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute

However, the ecology of the microenvironment of a neoplastic cell determines which changes provide adaptive benefits. There is widespread recognition of the importance of these evolutionary and ecological processes in cancer, but to date, no system has been proposed for drawing clinically relevant distinctions between how different tumours are evolving. On the basis of a consensus conference of experts in the fields of cancer evolution and cancer ecology, we propose a framework for classifying tumours that is based on four relevant components. These are the diversity of neoplastic cells (intratumoural heterogeneity) and changes over time in that diversity, which make up an evolutionary index (Evo-index), as well as the hazards to neoplastic cell survival and the resources available to neoplastic cells, which make up an ecological index (Eco-index).

It is known that the DTC microenvironment plays an important role in sustaining their survival, regulating their growth, and conferring resistance to therapy.

Non-penetrating, high-density nanowire arrays display rich interactions between the nanostructured substrate and the micro/nanoscale features of cell surfaces. Such interactions enable efficient capture of rare cells including circulating tumor cells and trafficking leukocytes from complex biospecimens.

The developmental switch from fetal γ-globin to adult β-globin is governed in part by the transcription factor (TF) BCL11A. This TF has been proposed as a therapeutic target for reactivation of γ-globin and concomitant reduction of β-sickle globin. In this and other approaches, genetic alteration of a portion of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment leads to a mixture of sickling and corrected red blood cells (RBCs) in periphery. To reverse the sickling phenotype, a certain proportion of corrected RBCs is necessary; the degree of HSC alteration required to achieve a desired fraction of corrected RBCs remains unknown. To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model describing aging and survival of sickle-susceptible and normal RBCs; the former can have a selective survival advantage leading to their overrepresentation. We identified the level of bone marrow chimerism required for successful stem cell-based gene therapies in SCD. Our findings were further informed using an experimental mouse model, where we transplanted mixtures of Berkeley SCD and normal murine bone marrow cells to establish chimeric grafts in murine hosts. Our integrative theoretical and experimental approach identifies the target frequency of HSC alterations required for effective treatment of sickling syndromes in humans. Our work replaces episodic observations of such target frequencies with a mathematical modeling framework that covers a large and continuous spectrum of chimerism conditions. Am. J.

Treatment of EGFR-mutant GBM cell lines with the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib can effectively induce cell death in these models. However, EGFR inhibitors have shown little efficacy in the clinic, partly because of inappropriate dosing. Here, we developed a computational approach to model the in vitro cellular dynamics of the EGFR-mutant cell line SF268 in response to different lapatinib concentrations and dosing schedules. We then used this approach to identify an effective treatment strategy within the clinical toxicity limits of lapatinib, and developed a partial differential equation modeling approach to study the in vivo GBM treatment response by taking into account the heterogeneous and diffusive nature of the disease. Despite the inability of lapatinib to induce tumor regressions with a continuous daily schedule, our modeling approach consistently predicts that continuous dosing remains the best clinically feasible strategy for slowing down tumor growth and lowering overall tumor burden, compared to pulsatile schedules currently known to be tolerated, even when considering drug resistance, reduced lapatinib tumor concentrations due to the blood brain barrier, and the phenotypic switch from proliferative to migratory cell phenotypes that occurs in hypoxic microenvironments.

The existence of a multitude of resistance mechanisms necessitates administering drugs in combination, significantly complicating the endeavor of predicting the evolutionary dynamics of cancers and optimal intervention strategies. A thorough understanding of the important determinants of cancer evolution under combination therapies is therefore crucial for correctly predicting treatment outcomes. Here we developed the first computational strategy to explore pharmacokinetic and drug interaction effects in evolutionary models of cancer progression, a crucial step towards making clinically relevant predictions. We found that incorporating these phenomena into our multiscale stochastic modeling framework significantly changes the optimum drug administration schedules identified, often predicting nonintuitive strategies for combination therapies. We applied our approach to an ongoing phase Ib clinical trial (TATTON) administering AZD9291 and selumetinib to EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients. Our results suggest that the schedules used in the three trial arms have almost identical efficacies, but slight modifications in the dosing frequencies of the two drugs can significantly increase tumor cell eradication.

Improved understanding of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors at the molecular level is one promising route to identifying the limits on extrinsic control of tumor initiation, which is highly relevant to cancer prevention.

We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected CpG island promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types. Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used-and frequently oncogenic-signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic cofactors.

A wide range of experiments demonstrated that in their compacted state, mammalian chromosomes form arrays of closely stacked consecutive ∼100 kb loops. The mechanism underlying the active process of chromosome compaction into a stack of loops is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that chromosomes are compacted by enzymatic machines that actively extrude chromatin loops. When such loop-extruding factors (LEF) bind to chromosomes, they progressively bridge sites that are further away along the chromosome, thus extruding a loop. We demonstrate that collective action of LEFs leads to formation of a dynamic array of consecutive loops. Simulations and an analytically solved model identify two distinct steady states: a sparse state, where loops are highly dynamic but provide little compaction; and a dense state, where there are more stable loops and dramatic chromosome compaction. We find that human chromosomes operate at the border of the dense steady state. Our analysis also shows how the macroscopic characteristics of the loop array are determined by the microscopic properties of LEFs and their abundance. When the number of LEFs are used that match experimentally based estimates, the model can quantitatively reproduce the average loop length, the degree of compaction, and the general loop-array morphology of compact human chromosomes.

Recent studies have shown that TAD disruption is often found in cancer cells and contributes to oncogenesis through two mechanisms. One mechanism locally disrupts domains by deleting or mutating a TAD boundary leading to fusion of the two adjacent TADs. The other mechanism involves genomic rearrangements that break up TADs and creates new ones without directly affecting TAD boundaries.

We use a single-DNA magnetic tweezers assay to study compaction of DNA by yeast condensin, with the result that only the multimer shows ATP-enhanced DNA-compaction. The compaction reaction involves step-like events of 200 nm (600 bp) size and is strongly suppressed by forces above 1 pN, consistent with a loop-capture mechanism for initial binding and compaction. The compaction reactions are largely insensitive to DNA torsional stress. Our results suggest a physiological role for oligomerized condensin in driving gradual chromatin compaction by step-like and slow ""creeping"" dynamics consistent with a loop-extrusion mechanism.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"chromatin organization, chromatin modeling, mitosis, magnetic tweezers, condensin, ATP","Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism|Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism|Biomechanical Phenomena|Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/physiology|DNA/metabolism|DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism|Fungal Proteins/metabolism|Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism|Nucleic Acid Conformation|Protein Binding|Saccharomycetales|Stress, Mechanical","Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism|Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism|Biomechanical Phenomena|Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/physiology|DNA/metabolism|DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism|Fungal Proteins/metabolism|Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism|Nucleic Acid Conformation|Protein Binding|Saccharomycetales|Stress, Mechanical",larg scale chromatin remodel mitosi catalyz heteropentamer enzym known condensin dna organ mechan condensin depend energi atp hydrolysi specif promot proper compact segreg chromosom mitosi remain poorli understood purif bud yeast condensin reveal occur classic heteropentamer monom form adopt much larger configur consist oligomer singl dna magnet tweezer assay compact dna yeast condensin multim atp enhanc dna compact compact reaction involv step like event nm 600 bp size strongli suppress forc pn consist loop captur mechan initi bind compact compact reaction larg insensit dna torsion stress physiolog role oligomer condensin drive gradual chromatin compact step like slow creep dynam consist loop extrus mechanism.,Chicago Region Physical Science Oncology Center

Abnormal nuclear morphology and protrusions termed ""blebs"" are diagnostic markers for many human afflictions including heart disease, aging, progeria, and cancer. Nuclear blebs are associated with both lamin and chromatin alterations. A number of prior studies suggest that lamins dictate nuclear morphology, but the contributions of altered chromatin compaction remain unclear. We show that chromatin histone modification state dictates nuclear rigidity, and modulating it is sufficient to both induce and suppress nuclear blebs. Treatment of mammalian cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors to increase euchromatin or histone methyltransferase inhibitors to decrease heterochromatin results in a softer nucleus and nuclear blebbing, without perturbing lamins. Conversely, treatment with histone demethylase inhibitors increases heterochromatin and chromatin nuclear rigidity, which results in reduced nuclear blebbing in lamin B1 null nuclei. Notably, increased heterochromatin also rescues nuclear morphology in a model cell line for the accelerated aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome caused by mutant lamin A, as well as cells from patients with the disease.

Previous work using partial-wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, a quantitative imaging technique with sensitivity to macromolecular organization between 20 and 200 nm, has shown that transformation of chromatin at these length scales is a fundamental event during carcinogenesis. As the dynamics of chromatin likely play a critical regulatory role in cellular function, it is critical to develop live-cell imaging techniques that can probe the real-time temporal behavior of the chromatin nanoarchitecture. Therefore, we developed a live-cell PWS technique that allows high-throughput, label-free study of the causal relationship between nanoscale organization and molecular function in real time. In this work, we use live-cell PWS to study the change in chromatin structure due to DNA damage and expand on the link between metabolic function and the structure of higher-order chromatin. In particular, we studied the temporal changes to chromatin during UV light exposure, show that live-cell DNA-binding dyes induce damage to chromatin within seconds, and demonstrate a direct link between higher-order chromatin structure and mitochondrial membrane potential.

In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancers are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries.

The IL-10-induced immunosuppressive phenotype was largely insensitive to co-administered IL-12, which has been reported to modulate macrophage phenotype, but maintaining the immunosuppressive phenotype required sustained exposure to IL-10. Our data implicate the intracellular protein, BCL3, as a key mediator of the IL-10-driven phenotype.

Contemporary views on the origin of tumors focus mainly on the role of particular sets of driver transformations, mutational or epigenetic, with the occurrence of the observed heterogeneity as an accidental byproduct of oncogenesis. As such, we present a hypothesis that tumors form due to heterogeneous adaptive selection in response to environmental stress through intrinsic genomic sampling mechanisms. Specifically, we propose that eukaryotic cells intrinsically explore their available genomic information, the greater genomic landscape (GGL), in response to stress under normal conditions, long before the formation of a cancerous lesion. Finally, considering the influence of chromatin heterogeneity on the GGL, we propose a new class of compounds, chromatin-protective therapies (CPT), which target the physical variations in chromatin topology.

We report single-DNA experiments for Bxb1 integrase, a model SR, where dynamics of individual synapses were observed, using relaxation of supercoiling to report on cleavage and rotation events. Relaxation events often consist of multiple rotations, with the number of rotations per relaxation event and rotation velocity sensitive to DNA sequence at the center of the recombination crossover site, torsional stress and salt concentration. Bulk and single-DNA experiments indicate that the thermodynamic stability of the annealed, but cleaved, crossover sites controls ligation efficiency of recombinant and parental synaptic complexes, regulating the number of rotations during a breakage-religation cycle. The outcome is consistent with a 'controlled rotation' model analogous to that observed for type IB topoisomerases, with religation probability varying in accord with DNA base-pairing free energies at the crossover site.

Single-DNA looping assays using an activated mutant (Hin-H107Y) reveal specific synapses between two hix sites. Two-DNA ""braiding"" experiments, where separate DNA molecules carrying a single hix are interwound, show that Hin-H107Y cleaves both hix sites and mediates multi-step rotational relaxation of the interwinding. The variable numbers of rotations in the DNA braid experiments are in accord with data from bulk experiments that follow DNA topological changes accompanying recombination by the hyperactive enzyme. The relatively slow Hin rotation rates, combined with pauses, indicate considerable rotary friction between synapsed subunit pairs.

During mitosis, chromatin undergoes dramatic changes: transcription stalls, chromatin-binding factors leave the chromatin, histone modifications change and chromatin becomes highly condensed. Many key insights into mitotic chromosome state and conformation have come from extensive microscopy studies over the last century. Over the last decade, the development of 3C-based techniques has enabled the study of higher order chromosome organization during mitosis in a genome-wide manner. During mitosis, chromosomes lose their cell type-specific and locus-dependent chromatin organization that characterizes interphase chromatin and fold into randomly positioned loop arrays. Upon exit of mitosis, cells are capable of quickly rearranging the chromosome conformation to form the cell type-specific interphase organization again. The information that enables this rearrangement after mitotic exit is thought to be encoded at least in part in mitotic bookmarks, e.g. histone modifications and variants, histone remodelers, chromatin factors, and non-coding RNA. Here we give an overview of the chromosomal organization and epigenetic characteristics of interphase and mitotic chromatin in vertebrates.

We study the kinetics of dissociation of the abundant Escherichia coli nucleoid protein Fis from DNA, using a single-molecule mechanics assay. The rate of Fis dissociation from DNA is strongly dependent on the solution concentration of DNA. The off-rate (k(off)) of Fis from DNA shows an initially linear dependence on solution DNA concentration, characterized by an exchange rate of k(ex)≈9×10(-4) (ng/μl)(-1) s(-1) for 100 mM univalent salt buffer, with a very small off-rate at zero DNA concentration. The off-rate saturates at approximately k(off,max)≈8×10(-3) s(-1) for DNA concentrations above ≈20 ng/μl. This exchange reaction depends mainly on DNA concentration with little dependence on the length of the DNA molecules in solution or on binding affinity, but this does increase with increasing salt concentration. We also show data for the yeast HMGB protein NHP6A showing a similar DNA-concentration-dependent dissociation effect, with faster rates suggesting generally weaker DNA binding by NHP6A relative to Fis. Our results are well described by a model with an intermediate partially dissociated state where the protein is susceptible to being captured by a second DNA segment, in the manner of ""direct transfer"" reactions studied for other DNA-binding proteins.

The standard description of bimolecular interactions posits that TF off rates are independent of TF concentration in solution. However, recent observations have revealed that proteins in solution can accelerate the dissociation of DNA-bound proteins. To study the molecular basis of facilitated dissociation (FD), we have used single-molecule imaging to measure dissociation kinetics of Fis, a key <i>Escherichia coli</i> TF and major bacterial nucleoid protein, from single dsDNA binding sites. We observe a strong FD effect characterized by an exchange rate [Formula: see text], establishing that FD of Fis occurs at the single-binding site level, and we find that the off rate saturates at large Fis concentrations in solution. Although spontaneous (i.e., competitor-free) dissociation shows a strong salt dependence, we find that FD depends only weakly on salt. These results are quantitatively explained by a model in which partially dissociated bound proteins are susceptible to invasion by competitor proteins in solution. We also report FD of NHP6A, a yeast TF with structure that differs significantly from Fis. We further perform molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that FD can occur for molecules that interact far more weakly than those that we have studied.

We explored the relationship between the physical nanoenvironment of chromatin and gene transcription in vitro. We analytically show that changes in the fractal dimension, D, of chromatin correspond to simultaneous increases in chromatin accessibility and compaction heterogeneity. Using these predictions, we demonstrate experimentally that nanoscopic changes to chromatin D within thirty minutes correlate with concomitant enhancement and suppression of transcription. Further, we show that the increased heterogeneity of physical structure of chromatin due to increase in fractal dimension correlates with increased heterogeneity of gene networks.

Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggest that mildly deleterious passengers accumulate and can collectively slow cancer progression. Clinical data also suggest an association between passenger load and response to therapeutics, yet no causal link between the effects of passengers and cancer progression has been established. To assess this, we introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and immunocompromised mouse models. We found that passengers dramatically reduced proliferative fitness (∼3% per Mb), slowed tumor growth, and reduced metastatic progression. We developed new genomic measures of damaging passenger load that can accurately predict the fitness costs of passengers in cell lines and in human breast cancers. We conclude that genomic instability and an elevated load of DNA alterations in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, but incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh driver benefit. The effects of passenger alterations on cancer fitness were unrelated to enhanced immunity, as our tests were performed either in cell culture or in immunocompromised animals. Our findings refute traditional paradigms of passengers as neutral events, suggesting that passenger load reduces the fitness of cancer cells and slows or prevents progression of both primary and metastatic disease. The antitumor effects of chemotherapies can in part be due to the induction of genomic instability and increased passenger load. <i>Cancer Res; 77(18); 4763-72. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"DNA-seq, simulation","Animals|Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics|Breast/metabolism|Breast/pathology|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics|Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology|Cells, Cultured|Disease Progression|Female|Humans|Lung Neoplasms/genetics|Lung Neoplasms/secondary|Mice|Mice, SCID|Mutation","Animals|Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics|Breast/metabolism|Breast/pathology|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics|Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology|Cells, Cultured|Disease Progression|Female|Humans|Lung Neoplasms/genetics|Lung Neoplasms/secondary|Mice|Mice, SCID|Mutation",genom instabl high mutat rate caus acquir numer mutat chromosom alter somat evolut term passeng confer phenotyp evolutionari simul genom mildli deleteri passeng accumul collect slow progress clinic passeng load respons therapeut yet causal link passeng progress establish introduc passeng load human line immunocompromis mous model passeng dramat reduc prolif fit per mb slow growth reduc metastat progress new genom measur damag passeng load accur predict fit cost passeng line human breast conclud genom instabl elev load dna alter doubl edg sword acceler accumul adapt driver incur harm passeng load outweigh driver benefit passeng alter fit unrel enhanc immun test either cultur immunocompromis anim find refut tradit paradigm passeng neutral event passeng load reduc fit slow prevent progress primari metastat diseas antitumor chemotherapi part due induct genom instabl passeng load 77 4763 aacr,Chicago Region Physical Science Oncology Center

Nucleosomes regulate gene expression by sterically occluding transcription factors (TFs) and other non-histone proteins accessing genomic DNA. How the binding competition between nucleosomes and TFs leads to transcriptionally compatible promoter states is an open question. Here, we present a computational study of the nucleosome dynamics and organization in the promoter region of PHO5 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Introducing a model for nucleosome kinetics that takes into account ATP-dependent remodeling activity, DNA sequence effects, and kinetics of TFs (Pho4p), we compute the probability of obtaining different ""promoter states"" having different nucleosome configurations. Comparing our results with experimental data, we argue that the presence of local remodeling activity (LRA) as opposed to basal remodeling activity (BRA) is crucial in determining transcriptionally active promoter states. By modulating the LRA and Pho4p binding rate, we obtain different mRNA distributions-Poisson, bimodal, and long-tail. Through this work we explain many features of the PHO5 promoter such as sequence-dependent TF accessibility and the role of correlated dynamics between nucleosomes and TFs in opening/coverage of the TATA box.

However, we found that deformed shapes of nuclei are unchanged even after removal of the cell with micro-dissection, both for smooth, elongated nuclei in fibroblasts and abnormally shaped nuclei in breast cancer cells. The lack of shape relaxation implies that the nuclear shape in spread cells does not store any elastic energy, and the cellular stresses that deform the nucleus are dissipative, not static. During cell spreading, the deviation of the nucleus from a convex shape increased in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, but decreased in MCF-10A cells. Tracking changes of nuclear and cellular shape on micropatterned substrata revealed that fibroblast nuclei deform only during deformations in cell shape and only in the direction of nearby moving cell boundaries.

Here, we incorporate a mechanochemical free-energy-based approach to elucidate how the two-way feedback loop between cell contractility (induced by the activity of chemomechanical interactions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Rho signaling pathways) and matrix fiber realignment and strain stiffening enables the cells to polarize and develop contractile forces to break free from the tumor spheroids and invade into the ECM. Interestingly, through this computational model, we are able to identify a critical stiffness that is required by the matrix to break intercellular adhesions and initiate cell invasion. Also, by considering the kinetics of the cell movement, our model predicts a biphasic invasiveness with respect to the stiffness of the matrix. These predictions are validated by analyzing the invasion of melanoma cells in collagen matrices of varying concentration. Our model also predicts a positive correlation between the elongated morphology of the invading cells and the alignment of fibers in the matrix, suggesting that cell polarization is directly proportional to the stiffness and alignment of the matrix. In contrast, cells in nonfibrous matrices are found to be rounded and not polarized, underscoring the key role played by the nonlinear mechanics of fibrous matrices.

Here we demonstrate that rigidity of a phagocytosed cell also hyperactivates myosin-II, which locally overwhelms self-signaling at a phagocytic synapse. Cell stiffness is one among many factors including shape that changes in erythropoiesis, in senescence and in diseases ranging from inherited anemias and malaria to cancer. Controlled stiffening of normal human red blood cells (RBCs) in different shapes does not compromise CD47's interaction with the macrophage self-recognition receptor signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA). Uptake of antibody-opsonized RBCs is always fastest with rigid RBC discocytes, which also show that maximal active myosin-II at the synapse can dominate self-signaling by CD47. Rigid but rounded RBC stomatocytes signal self better than rigid RBC discocytes, highlighting the effects of shape on CD47 inhibition.

In marrow, megakaryocytes extend projections into the microcirculation, where shear facilitates fragmentation to large pre/proplatelets, suggesting that fluid stresses and myosin-II activity somehow couple in platelet biogenesis. Here, in bulk shear, plateletlike particles generated from megakaryocytes are maximized at a shear stress typical of that in the microcirculation and after treatment with a myosin-II inhibitor. MIIA activity in static cells is naturally repressed through phosphorylation at Serine-1943, but shear decreases phosphorylation, consistent with MIIA activation and localization to platelet cortex.

Matrix stiffens locally-as in scars-while allowing separate control over adhesive-ligand density. The MMMS elicits scar-like phenotypes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs): cells spread and polarize quickly, increasing nucleoskeletal lamin-A yet expressing the 'scar marker' smooth muscle actin (SMA) more slowly. Surprisingly, expression responses to MMMS exhibit less cell-to-cell noise than homogeneously stiff gels. Such differences from bulk-average responses arise because a strong SMA repressor, NKX2.5, slowly exits the nucleus on rigid matrices. NKX2.5 overexpression overrides rigid phenotypes, inhibiting SMA and cell spreading, whereas cytoplasm-localized NKX2.5 mutants degrade in well-spread cells. MSCs thus form a 'mechanical memory' of rigidity by progressively suppressing NKX2.5, thereby elevating SMA in a scar-like state.

Increasing the stiffness of flat hydrogel surfaces induced mesenchymal stem cell spreading and proliferation; however, increasing fibre stiffness instead suppressed spreading and proliferation for certain network architectures. Lower fibre stiffness permitted active cellular forces to recruit nearby fibres, dynamically increasing ligand density at the cell surface and promoting the formation of focal adhesions and related signalling.

We show that there are three regimes for FA evolution depending on their size. Specifically, nascent adhesions with initial lengths below a critical value that are yet to engage in actin fibers will dissolve, whereas bigger ones will grow into mature FAs with a steady state size. In adhesions where growth surpasses the steady state size, disassembly will occur until their sizes are reduced to the equilibrium state. This finding arises from the fact that polymerization of adhesion proteins is force-dependent. Under actomyosin contraction, individual integrin bonds within small FAs (i.e., nascent adhesions or focal complexes) must transmit higher loads while the phenomenon of stress concentration occurs at the edge of large adhesion patches. As such, an effective stiffness of the FA-extracellular matrix complex that is either too small or too large will be relatively low, resulting in a limited actomyosin pulling force developed at the edge that is insufficient to prevent disassembly. Furthermore, it is found that a stiffer extracellular matrix and/or nucleus, as well as a stronger chemomechanical feedback, will induce larger adhesions along with a higher level of contraction force. Interestingly, switching the extracellular side from an elastic half-space, corresponding to some widely used in vitro gel substrates, to a one-dimensional fiber (as in the case of cells anchoring to a fibrous scaffold in vivo) does not qualitative change these conclusions. Our model predictions are in good agreement with a variety of experimental observations obtained in this study as well as those reported in the literature.

The mechanical response of tissues such as liver to physiological stresses is not well described, and models of tissue mechanics are limited. To better understand the mechanics of the normal and fibrotic rat liver, we carried out a series of studies using parallel plate rheometry, measuring the response to compressive, extensional, and shear strains. We found that the shear storage and loss moduli G' and G"" and the apparent Young's moduli measured by uniaxial strain orthogonal to the shear direction increased markedly with both progressive fibrosis and increasing compression, that livers shear strain softened, and that significant increases in shear modulus with compressional stress occurred within a range consistent with increased sinusoidal pressures in liver disease. Proteoglycan content and integrin-matrix interactions were significant determinants of liver mechanics, particularly in compression. We propose a new non-linear constitutive model of the liver. A key feature of this model is that, while it assumes overall liver incompressibility, it takes into account water flow and solid phase compressibility. In sum, we report a detailed study of non-linear liver mechanics under physiological strains in the normal state, early fibrosis, and late fibrosis. We propose a constitutive model that captures compression stiffening, tension softening, and shear softening, and can be understood in terms of the cellular and matrix components of the liver.

Linearity between the widely varying projected area of a cell and its nucleus across many matrices, timescales, and myosin-II activity levels indicates a constant ratio of nucleus-to-cell volume, despite MSCs' lineage plasticity. Nuclear envelope fluctuations are suppressed on the stiffest matrices, and fluctuation spectra reveal a high nuclear tension that matches trends from traction force microscopy and from increased lamin-A,C. Transcriptomes of many diverse tissues and MSCs further show that lamin-A,C's increase with tissue or matrix stiffness anti-correlates with lamin-B receptor (LBR), which contributes to lipid/sterol biosynthesis. Adipogenesis (a soft lineage) indeed increases LBR:lamin-A,C protein stoichiometry in MSCs versus osteogenesis (stiff).

The model predicts that FA size depends on both the stiffness of ECM and the density of ligands available to form adhesions. Although these two quantities are independent in commonly used hydrogels, contractile cells break cross-links in soft fibrous matrices leading to recruitment of fibers, which increases the ligand density in the vicinity of cells. Consequently, although the size of focal adhesions increases with ECM stiffness in nonfibrous and elastic hydrogels, plasticity of fibrous networks leads to a departure from the well-described positive correlation between stiffness and FA size. We predict a phase diagram that describes nonmonotonic behavior of FA in the space spanned by ECM stiffness and recruitment index, which describes the ability of cells to break cross-links and recruit fibers.

This defining ability to ""phagos"" or devour can subsequently activate the entire immune system against foreign and diseased cells, and progress is now being made on a decades-old idea of directing macrophages to phagocytose specific targets, such as cancer cells. Engineered T cells provide precedence with recent clinical successes against liquid tumors, but solid tumors remain a challenge, and a handful of clinical trials seek to exploit the abundance of tumor-associated macrophages instead. Although macrophage differentiation into such phenotypes with deficiencies in phagocytic ability can raise challenges, newly recognized features of cancer cells that might be manipulated to increase the phagocytosis of those cells include ≥1 membrane protein, CD47, which broadly inhibits phagocytosis and is abundantly expressed on all healthy cells.

Inflammatory cytokines modify the tumour microenvironment by recruiting immune cells and are critical for both local and systemic (abscopal) tumour responses to radiotherapy. A poorly understood feature of these responses is the delayed onset (days), in contrast to the acute DNA-damage responses that occur in minutes to hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate-limiting steps that are essential for DNA-damage-induced inflammation. Here we show that cell cycle progression through mitosis following double-stranded DNA breaks leads to the formation of micronuclei, which precede activation of inflammatory signalling and are a repository for the pattern-recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-cGAS impaired interferon signalling. Moreover, STING loss prevented the regression of abscopal tumours in the context of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo.

Here, SIRPα on macrophages from mouse and human marrow was inhibited to block recognition of its ligand, the ""marker of self"" CD47 on all other cells. These macrophages were then systemically injected into mice with fluorescent human tumors that had been antibody targeted. Within days, the tumors regressed, and single-cell fluorescence analyses showed that the more the macrophages engulfed, the more they accumulated within regressing tumors. Human-marrow-derived macrophages engorged on the human tumors, while TAMs were minimally phagocytic, even toward CD47-knockdown tumors. Past studies had opsonized tumors in situ with antibody and/or relied on mouse TAMs but had not injected SIRPα-inhibited cells; also, unlike past injections of anti-CD47, blood parameters remained normal and safe. Consistent with tumor-selective engorge-and-accumulate processes in vivo, phagocytosis in vitro inhibited macrophage migration through micropores that mimic features of dense 3D tissue. Accumulation of SIRPα-inhibited macrophages in tumors favored tumor regression for 1-2 weeks, but donor macrophages quickly differentiated toward non-phagocytic, high-SIRPα TAMs. Analyses of macrophages on soft (like marrow) or stiff (like solid tumors) collagenous gels demonstrated a stiffness-driven, retinoic-acid-modulated upregulation of SIRPα and the mechanosensitive nuclear marker lamin-A.

Here the rigidity of cross-linked collagen synergizes with retinoids in the osteogenesis of human marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Collagen nanofilms serve as a model matrix that MSCs can easily deform unless the film is enzymatically cross-linked, which promotes the spreading of cells and the stiffening of nuclei as both actomyosin assembly and nucleoskeletal lamin-A increase. Expression of lamin-A is known to be controlled by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) transcription factors, but soft matrix prevents any response to any retinoids. Rigid matrix is needed to induce rapid nuclear accumulation of the RARG isoform and for RARG-specific antagonist to increase or maintain expression of lamin-A as well as for RARG-agonist to repress expression. A progerin allele of lamin-A is regulated in the same manner in iPSC-derived MSCs. Rigid matrices are further required for eventual expression of osteogenic markers, and RARG-antagonist strongly drives lamin-A-dependent osteogenesis on rigid substrates, with pretreated xenografts calcifying in vivo to a similar extent as native bone.

Membrane invaginations in vesicles were observed forming away from the leaflet with higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces negative curvature.

Matrix stiffness is among the cues that multiple stem cell types can sense and respond to. This seminar-style review focuses on mechanosensing of matrix elasticity in the differentiation or early maturation of a few illustrative stem cell types, with an intended audience of biologists and physical scientists. Contractile forces applied by a cell's acto-myosin cytoskeleton are often resisted by the extracellular matrix and transduced through adhesions and the cytoskeleton ultimately into the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Complexity is added by matrix heterogeneity, and careful scrutiny of the evident stiffness heterogeneity in some model systems resolves some controversies concerning matrix mechanosensing. Importantly, local stiffness tends to dominate, and 'durotaxis' of stem cells toward stiff matrix reveals a dependence of persistent migration on myosin-II force generation and also rigid microtubules that confer directionality. Stem and progenitor cell migration in 3D can be further affected by matrix porosity as well as stiffness, with nuclear size and rigidity influencing niche retention and fate choices. Cell squeezing through rigid pores can even cause DNA damage and genomic changes that contribute to de-differentiation toward stem cell-like states.

We treat the nucleus as an elastic-fluid system with an elastic component (chromatin) and fluid component that can be squeezed out when the nucleus is deformed. We couple the elastic-fluid model to the kinetics of DNA breakage and repair by assuming that the local volume fraction of the elastic component controls the rate of damage per unit volume due to naturally occurring DNA breaks, whereas the volume fraction of the fluid component controls the rate of repair of DNA breaks per unit volume by repair factors, which are soluble in the fluid. By comparing our results to a number of experiments on controlled migration through pores, we show that squeeze-out of the fluid, and hence of the mobile repair factors, is sufficient to account for the extent of DNA damage and genomic variation observed experimentally.

Recent experimental data suggest that during cell transmigration the deformability of the nucleus could be a limiting factor, and the morphological and structural alterations that the nucleus encounters can perturb genomic organization that in turn influences cellular behavior. Despite its importance, a biophysical model that connects the experimentally observed nuclear morphological changes to the underlying biophysical factors during transmigration through small constrictions is still lacking. Here, we developed a universal chemomechanical model that describes nuclear strains and shapes and predicts thresholds for the rupture of the nuclear envelope and for nuclear plastic deformation during transmigration through small constrictions. The model includes actin contraction and cytosolic back pressure that squeeze the nucleus through constrictions and overcome the mechanical resistance from deformation of the nucleus and the constrictions. The nucleus is treated as an elastic shell encompassing a poroelastic material representing the nuclear envelope and inner nucleoplasm, respectively. Tuning the chemomechanical parameters of different components such as cell contractility and nuclear and matrix stiffnesses, our model predicts the lower bounds of constriction size for successful transmigration. Furthermore, treating the chromatin as a plastic material, our model faithfully reproduced the experimentally observed irreversible nuclear deformations after transmigration in lamin-A/C-deficient cells, whereas the wild-type cells show much less plastic deformation.

At the cellular scale-where typical dimensions are in the order of micrometers-the effects arising from the molecular scale can either be modeled as equilibrium or non-equilibrium processes. In this chapter, we discuss the dynamically triangulated Monte Carlo technique to model and simulate membrane morphologies at the cellular scale, which in turn can be used to investigate several questions related to shape regulation in cells. In particular, we focus on two specific problems within the framework of isotropic and anisotropic elasticity theories: namely, (i) the origin of complex, physiologically relevant, membrane shapes due to the interaction of the membrane with curvature remodeling proteins, and (ii) the genesis of steady state cellular shapes due to the action of non-equilibrium forces that are generated by the fission and fusion of transport vesicles and by the binding and unbinding of proteins from the parent membrane.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,intrigu question biolog regul shape commonli believ cellular morpholog complex interact among lipid molecul constitut membran number macromolecul believ common biophys process essenti function play import role cellular morphogenesi cellular scale typic dimens order micromet aris molecular scale either model equilibrium non equilibrium process chapter discuss dynam triangul mont carlo techniqu model simul membran morpholog cellular scale turn investig sever question relat shape regul particular focu specif problem within framework isotrop anisotrop elast theori name (i origin complex physiolog relev membran shape due interact membran curvatur remodel ii genesi steadi state cellular shape due action non equilibrium forc gener fission fusion transport vesicl bind unbind parent membrane.,Physical Science Oncology Center at Penn

We quantitatively investigate membrane curvature generation by means of a GUV shape stability assay. We found that the amount of crowding required to induce membrane curvature is correlated with membrane tension. Importantly, we also revealed that at the same membrane tension, the crowding mechanism requires far higher protein coverage to induce curvature changes compared to those observed for the endophilin BAR domain, serving here as an example of an endocytic accessory protein.

Here, we show that subcellular localization of the MTOC is modulated by extracellular matrix stiffness. In scratch wound assays as well as single cell migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) the MTOC appears randomly positioned when cells are migrating on soft matrix, whereas on stiff matrix the MTOC is in front of the nucleus. The bulk of the microtubule density is also equally likely to be in front of or behind the nucleus on soft matrix, but it is polarized in front of the nucleus on stiff matrix. This occurred during cell migration with cells in interphase. During cytokinesis, the centrosomes polarize on either side of the chromosomes even on soft matrix, with MIIB localized strongly in the cleavage furrow which depolarizes only on soft matrix as cells exit cytokinesis. When cells are immobilized on micro-patterns printed on the top of substrates of different stiffness, MIIB polarized if the matrix was sufficiently stiff similar to results with migrating cells. However, the MTOC was randomly positioned with respect to the nucleus independent of matrix stiffness.

In contrast, we propose here that, in the early embryonic heart tube, the signaling mechanism coordinating beats is mechanical rather than electrical. We present a simple biophysical model in which CMs are mechanically excitable inclusions embedded within the extracellular matrix (ECM), modeled as an elastic-fluid biphasic material. Our model predicts strong stiffness dependence in both the heartbeat velocity and strain in isolated hearts, as well as the strain for a hydrogel-cultured CM, in quantitative agreement with recent experiments. We challenge our model with experiments disrupting electrical conduction by perfusing intact adult and embryonic hearts with a gap junction blocker, β-glycyrrhetinic acid (BGA). We find this treatment causes rapid failure in adult hearts but not embryonic hearts-consistent with our hypothesis.

A contractility tensor, which depends on the distribution of myosin motors, is introduced to describe the chemical free energy of the cell due to myosin recruitment. We explicitly include the contributions to the free energy that arise from mechanosensitive signalling pathways (such as the SFX, Rho-Rock and MLCK pathways) through chemo-mechanical coupling parameters. Taking the variations of the total free energy, which consists of the chemical and mechanical components, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics provides equations for the temporal evolution of the active stress and the contractility tensor. Following this approach, we are able to recover the well-known Hill relation for active stresses, based on the fundamental principles of irreversible thermodynamics rather than phenomenology. We have numerically implemented our free energy-based approach to model spatial distribution of strain and contractility in (i) cells supported by flexible microposts, (ii) cells on two-dimensional substrates, and (iii) cells in three-dimensional matrices. We demonstrate how the polarization of the cells and the orientation of stress fibres can be deduced from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the contractility tensor. Our calculations suggest that the chemical free energy of the cell decreases with the stiffness of the extracellular environment as the cytoskeleton polarizes in response to stress-dependent recruitment of molecular motors. The mechanical energy, which includes the strain energy and motor potential energy, however, increases with stiffness, but the overall energy is lower for cells in stiffer environments. This provides a thermodynamic basis for durotaxis, whereby cells preferentially migrate towards stiffer regions of the extracellular environment. Our models also explain, from an energetic perspective, why the shape of the cells can change in response to stiffness of the surroundings. The effect of the stiffness of the nucleus on its shape and the orientation of the stress fibres is also studied for all the above geometries. Along with making testable predictions, we have estimated the magnitudes of the chemo-mechanical coupling parameters for myofibroblasts based on data reported in the literature.

Here, constricted migration of two human cancer cell types and primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) increases DNA breaks throughout the nucleoplasm as assessed by endogenous damage markers and by electrophoretic ""comet"" measurements. Migration also causes multiple DNA repair proteins to segregate away from DNA, with cytoplasmic mis-localization sustained for many hours as is relevant to delayed repair. Partial knockdown of repair factors that also regulate chromosome copy numbers is seen to increase DNA breaks in U2OS osteosarcoma cells without affecting migration and with nucleoplasmic patterns of damage similar to constricted migration. Such depletion also causes aberrant levels of DNA. Migration-induced nuclear damage is nonetheless reversible for wild-type and sub-cloned U2OS cells, except for lasting genomic differences between stable clones as revealed by DNA arrays and sequencing. Gains and losses of hundreds of megabases in many chromosomes are typical of the changes and heterogeneity in bone cancer. Phenotypic differences that arise from constricted migration of U2OS clones are further illustrated by a clone with a highly elongated and stable MSC-like shape that depends on microtubule assembly downstream of the transcription factor GATA4.

We have previously described gene fusions of FGFR3-TACC3 (F3-T3) in 3% of human glioblastoma cases. Subsequent studies have reported similar frequencies of F3-T3 in many other cancers, indicating that F3-T3 is a commonly occuring fusion across all tumour types. F3-T3 fusions are potent oncogenes that confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors, but the downstream oncogenic signalling pathways remain unknown. Here we show that human tumours with F3-T3 fusions cluster within transcriptional subgroups that are characterized by the activation of mitochondrial functions. F3-T3 activates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and induces sensitivity to inhibitors of oxidative metabolism. Phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide PIN4 is an intermediate step in the signalling pathway of the activation of mitochondrial metabolism. The F3-T3-PIN4 axis triggers the biogenesis of peroxisomes and the synthesis of new proteins.

Mutations of PTPRD, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase regulating cell growth, were enriched in NMZL across mature B-cell tumors, functionally caused the loss of the phosphatase activity of PTPRD, and were associated with cell-cycle transcriptional program deregulation and increased proliferation index in NMZL. Although NMZL shared with SMZL a common mutation profile, NMZL harbored PTPRD lesions that were otherwise absent in SMZL.

Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-β.

RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a shorter survival.

To portray the mutational repertoire of dysplastic nevi in patients with the dysplastic nevus syndrome and to determine the discriminatory profiles of melanocytic nevi (including dysplastic nevi) from melanoma, we sequenced exomes of melanocytic nevi including dysplastic nevi (n = 19), followed by a targeted gene panel (785 genes) characterization of melanocytic nevi (n = 46) and primary melanomas (n = 42). Exome sequencing revealed that dysplastic nevi harbored a substantially lower mutational load than melanomas (21 protein-changing mutations versus >100). Known ""driver"" mutations in genes for melanoma, including CDKN2A, TP53, NF1, RAC1, and PTEN, were not found among any melanocytic nevi sequenced.

In bones, local hypoxia and activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in osteoblasts are essential to maintain skeletal homeostasis. However, the role of osteoblast-specific HIF signaling in cancer metastasis is unknown. Here, we show that osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) are located in hypoxic niches in the bone marrow and that activation of HIF signaling in these cells increases bone mass and favors breast cancer metastasis to bone locally. Remarkably, HIF signaling in osteoblast-lineage cells also promotes breast cancer growth and dissemination remotely, in the lungs and in other tissues distant from bones. Mechanistically, we found that activation of HIF signaling in OPCs increases blood levels of the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12), which leads to a systemic increase of breast cancer cell proliferation and dissemination through direct activation of the CXCR4 receptor. Hence, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role of the hypoxic osteogenic niche in promoting tumorigenesis beyond the local bone microenvironment.

Often, these changes underlie cancer development, progression, and drug resistance, so the utility of model systems rests on their ability to recapitulate the genomic aberrations observed in primary tumors. Tumor-derived cell lines have long been used to study the underlying biologic processes in cancer, as well as screening platforms for discovering and evaluating the efficacy of anticancer therapeutics. Multiple -omic measurements across more than a thousand cancer cell lines have been produced following advances in high-throughput technologies and multigroup collaborative projects. These data complement the large, international cancer genomic sequencing efforts to characterize patient tumors, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Given the scope and scale of data that have been generated, researchers are now in a position to evaluate the similarities and differences that exist in genomic features between cell lines and patient samples. As pharmacogenomics models, cell lines offer the advantages of being easily grown, relatively inexpensive, and amenable to high-throughput testing of therapeutic agents. Data generated from cell lines can then be used to link cellular drug response to genomic features, where the ultimate goal is to build predictive signatures of patient outcome.

We accomplished this by measuring cellular and molecular responses to lapatinib and the AKT inhibitors (AKTi) GSK690693 and GSK2141795 in a panel of 22 HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines carrying wild type or mutant PIK3CA. We observed that combinations of lapatinib plus AKTi were synergistic in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cell lines but not in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cell lines. We measured changes in phospho-protein levels in 15 cell lines after treatment with lapatinib, AKTi or lapatinib + AKTi to shed light on the underlying signaling dynamics. This revealed that p-S6RP levels were less well attenuated by lapatinib in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cells compared to HER2(+)/PIK3CAwt cells and that lapatinib + AKTi reduced p-S6RP levels to those achieved in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cells with lapatinib alone. We also found that that compensatory up-regulation of p-HER3 and p-HER2 is blunted in PIK3CA(mut) cells following lapatinib + AKTi treatment. Responses of HER2(+) SKBR3 cells transfected with lentiviruses carrying control or PIK3CA(mut )sequences were similar to those observed in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cell lines but not in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cell lines. We used a nonlinear ordinary differential equation model to support the idea that PIK3CA mutations act as downstream activators of AKT that blunt lapatinib inhibition of downstream AKT signaling and that the effects of PIK3CA mutations can be countered by combining lapatinib with an AKTi.

We systematically identified an optimal HER2 siRNA from 76 potential sequences and demonstrated its utility in overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib in 18 HER2-positive cancer cell lines. We provided evidence that the drug-resistant cancer maintains dependence on HER2 for survival. Importantly, cell lines did not readily develop resistance following extended treatment with HER2 siRNA. Using our recently developed nanoparticle platform, systemic delivery of HER2 siRNA to trastuzumab-resistant tumors resulted in significant growth inhibition.

With the availability of large-scale genomic profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic mutations and differentially expressed genes, which are believed to be responsible for heterogeneous drug responses. Although subtyping analysis has identified patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, there is no effective method to predict the drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably. Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the drug response of individual patients based on personal genomic profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic and drug sensitivity data. Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell lines (viewed as individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers and their responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The optimal drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by integrating the votes from other cell lines. The experimental results show that the proposed drug prediction algorithm can be used to improve greatly the reliability of finding optimal drugs for individual patients and will, thus, form a key component in the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.

Here we establish an EMT lineage-tracing system to monitor this process in mice, using a mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated fluorescent marker switch system in spontaneous breast-to-lung metastasis models. We show that within a predominantly epithelial primary tumour, a small proportion of tumour cells undergo EMT. Notably, lung metastases mainly consist of non-EMT tumour cells that maintain their epithelial phenotype. Inhibiting EMT by overexpressing the microRNA miR-200 does not affect lung metastasis development. However, EMT cells significantly contribute to recurrent lung metastasis formation after chemotherapy. These cells survived cyclophosphamide treatment owing to reduced proliferation, apoptotic tolerance and increased expression of chemoresistance-related genes. Overexpression of miR-200 abrogated this resistance. This study suggests the potential of an EMT-targeting strategy, in conjunction with conventional chemotherapies, for breast cancer treatment.

We established an in vivo approach to track the fate of tumor cells based on a novel EMT-driven fluorescent color switching breast cancer mouse model and intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Specifically, the MMTV-PyMT, Rosa26-RFP-GFP, and Fsp1-Cre triple transgenic mouse model was used to monitor the conversion of RFP-positive epithelial cells to GFP-positive mesenchymal cells in mammary tumors under the control of the Fsp1 (ATL1) promoter, a gate-keeper of EMT initiation. RFP-positive cells were isolated from the tumors, sorted, and transplanted into mammary fat pads of SCID mice to monitor EMT during breast tumor formation. We found that the conversion from RFP- to GFP-positive and spindle-shaped cells was a gradual process, and that GFP-positive cells preferentially localized close to blood vessels, independent of tumor size. Furthermore, cells undergoing EMT expressed high levels of the HGF receptor, c-Met, and treatment of RFP-positive cells with the c-Met inhibitor, cabozantinib, suppressed the RFP-to-GFP conversion in vitro Moreover, administration of cabozantinib to mice with palpable RFP-positive tumors resulted in a silent EMT phenotype whereby GFP-positive cells exhibited reduced motility, leading to suppressed tumor growth.

Ovarian tumor tissue is composed of cancer cells and a collection of different stromal cells. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates that stromal involvement is important in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, stroma-specific signaling pathways, stroma-derived factors, and genetic changes in the tumor stroma present unique opportunities for improving the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the major components of the tumor stroma that have demonstrated supportive roles in tumor progression. In this review, we highlight various types of signaling crosstalk between ovarian cancer cells and stromal cells, particularly with CAFs.

However, inherent biases in high-throughput assays make it difficult to interpret experiments in which more than one type of data is collected. In this work, we introduce Omics Integrator, a software package that takes a variety of 'omic' data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence, interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks connect changes observed in gene expression, protein abundance or other global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases. Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only positive data, but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased toward highly-studied hub proteins, except when they are strongly implicated by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools, Garnet and Forest, that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best connect the observed changes in various datasets.

These off-target effects can result from seed matches to unintended gene targets (reagent-based) or cellular pathways, which can compensate for gene perturbations (biology-based). We focus on the biology-based effects and use network modeling tools to discover pathways de novo around RNAi hits. By looking at hits in a functional context, we can uncover novel biology not identified from any individual 'omics measurement. We leverage multiple 'omic measurements using the Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Networks (SAMNet) computational framework to model a genome scale shRNA screen investigating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) progression in vivo. Our network model is enriched for cellular processes associated with hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis even though none of the individual 'omic sets showed this enrichment. The model identifies genes associated with the TGF-beta pathway and predicts a role in ALL progression for many genes without this functional annotation. We further experimentally validate the hidden genes - Wwp1, a ubiquitin ligase, and Hgs, a multi-vesicular body associated protein - for their role in ALL progression. Our ALL pathway model includes genes with roles in multiple types of leukemia and roles in hematological development. We identify a tumor suppressor role for Wwp1 in ALL progression.

Eight kinase inhibitors emerge that are known to affect 201 kinases, of which only three kinases have been previously identified as modifiers of gemcitabine toxicity. In this work, we use the SAMNet algorithm to identify pathways linking these kinases and genetic modifiers of gemcitabine toxicity with transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by gemcitabine that we measure using DNaseI-seq and RNA-seq. SAMNet uses a constrained optimization algorithm to connect genes from these complementary datasets through a small set of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The resulting network recapitulates known pathways including DNA repair, cell proliferation and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Of importance for disease is the release of ligands that activate the EGFR, such as TGFα, which is mostly carried out by ADAM17 [a member of the A-disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) domain family]. EGFR ligand shedding has been linked to many diseases, in particular cancer development, growth and metastasis, as well as resistance to cancer therapeutics. Excessive EGFR ligand release can outcompete therapeutic EGFR inhibition or the inhibition of other growth factor pathways by providing bypass signaling via EGFR activation. Drugging metalloproteases directly have failed clinically because it indiscriminately affected shedding of numerous substrates. It is therefore essential to identify regulators for EGFR ligand cleavage. Here, integration of a functional shRNA genomic screen, computational network analysis, and dedicated validation tests succeeded in identifying several key signaling pathways as novel regulators of TGFα shedding in cancer cells. Most notably, a cluster of genes with NFκB pathway regulatory functions was found to strongly influence TGFα release, albeit independent of their NFκB regulatory functions. Inflammatory regulators thus also govern cancer cell growth-promoting ectodomain cleavage, lending mechanistic understanding to the well-known connection between inflammation and cancer.<b>Implications:</b> Using genomic screens and network analysis, this study defines targets that regulate ectodomain shedding and suggests new treatment opportunities for EGFR-driven cancers. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 16(1); 147-61. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U01,,,Blood,Not Applicable,shRNA,,,,,,,microenvironment,,,,,"protein interaction network, computational biology, shRNA screen","Cell Line, Tumor|ErbB Receptors/metabolism|Gene Regulatory Networks|Genomics/methods|Humans|Jurkat Cells|Ligands|Models, Genetic|Neoplasms/genetics|Neoplasms/metabolism|RNA, Small Interfering/genetics|Signal Transduction|Transforming Growth Factor alpha/genetics|Transforming Growth Factor alpha/metabolism","Cell Line, Tumor|ErbB Receptors/metabolism|Gene Regulatory Networks|Genomics/methods|Humans|Jurkat Cells|Ligands|Models, Genetic|Neoplasms/genetics|Neoplasms/metabolism|RNA, Small Interfering/genetics|Signal Transduction|Transforming Growth Factor alpha/genetics|Transforming Growth Factor alpha/metabolism",ectodomain shed surfac precursor metalloproteas gener import cellular signal molecul import diseas releas ligand egfr tgfα mostli carri adam17 member disintegrin metalloproteas adam domain famili egfr ligand shed link mani diseas particular growth metastasi well resist therapeut excess egfr ligand releas outcompet therapeut egfr inhibit inhibit growth factor pathway provid bypass signal via egfr drug metalloproteas directli fail clinic indiscrimin affect shed numer substrat therefor essenti regul egfr ligand cleavag integr function shrna genom screen comput network dedic valid test succeed sever key signal pathway novel regul tgfα shed notabl cluster nfκb pathway regulatori function strongli influenc tgfα releas albeit independ nfκb regulatori function inflammatori regul thu govern growth promot ectodomain cleavag lend mechanist understand well known connect inflamm implic genom screen network defin target regul ectodomain shed new treatment opportun egfr driven mol 16 147 aacr,Embryonal Brain Tumor Networks

This integrates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with homology assignment through sequence, structure, and interaction topology. TransposeNet linked α-syn to multiple parkinsonism genes and druggable targets through perturbed protein trafficking and ER quality control as well as mRNA metabolism and translation. A calcium signaling hub linked these processes to perturbed mitochondrial quality control and function, metal ion transport, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. Parkinsonism gene interaction profiles spatially opposed in the network (ATP13A2/PARK9 and VPS35/PARK17) were highly distinct, and network relationships for specific genes (LRRK2/PARK8, ATXN2, and EIF4G1/PARK18) were confirmed in patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons.

Analogies between TICs and normal tissue stem cells have led to the proposal that activation of the normal stem-cell program within a tissue serves as the major mechanism for generating TICs. Supporting this notion, we and others previously established that the Slug epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF), a member of the Snail family, serves as a master regulator of the gland-reconstituting activity of normal mammary stem cells, and that forced expression of Slug in collaboration with Sox9 in breast cancer cells can efficiently induce entrance into the TIC state. However, these earlier studies focused on xenograft models with cultured cell lines and involved ectopic expression of EMT-TFs, often at non-physiological levels. Using genetically engineered knock-in reporter mouse lines, here we show that normal gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells residing in the basal layer of the mammary epithelium and breast TICs originating in the luminal layer exploit the paralogous EMT-TFs Slug and Snail, respectively, which induce distinct EMT programs. Broadly, our findings suggest that the seemingly similar stem-cell programs operating in TICs and normal stem cells of the corresponding normal tissue are likely to differ significantly in their details.

Multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) models are a class of continuous-time Markov chain models that capture the multi-hit initiation-promotion-malignant-conversion hypothesis of carcinogenesis. These models have been used broadly to investigate the epidemiology of many cancers, assess the impact of carcinogen exposures on cancer risk, and evaluate the potential impact of cancer prevention and control strategies on cancer rates. Structural identifiability (the analysis of the maximum parametric information available for a model given perfectly measured data) of certain MSCE models has been previously investigated. However, structural identifiability is a theoretical property and does not address the limitations of real data. In this study, we use pancreatic cancer as a case study to examine the practical identifiability of the two-, three-, and four-stage clonal expansion models given age-specific cancer incidence data using a numerical profile-likelihood approach. We demonstrate that, in the case of the three- and four-stage models, several parameters that are theoretically structurally identifiable, are, in practice, unidentifiable. This result means that key parameters such as the intermediate cell mutation rates are not individually identifiable from the data and that estimation of those parameters, even if structurally identifiable, will not be stable. We also show that products of these practically unidentifiable parameters are practically identifiable, and, based on this, we propose new reparameterizations of the model hazards that resolve the parameter estimation problems.

We use a systematic approach, based on differential algebra methods traditionally used for deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, to determine identifiable combinations for a generalized subclass of MSCE models with any number of preinitation stages and one clonal expansion.

We leverage multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) models coupled with age-period-cohort (APC) epidemiological models to analyze OSCC data in the SEER cancer registry (1973-2012). MSCE models are based on the initiation-promotion-malignant conversion paradigm in carcinogenesis and allow for interpretation of trends in terms of biological mechanisms. APC models seek to differentiate between the temporal effects of age, period, and birth cohort on cancer risk. Previous studies have looked at the effect of period and cohort on tumor initiation, and we extend this to compare model fits of period and cohort effects on each of tumor initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion rates. HPV-related, HPV-unrelated except oral tongue, and HPV-unrelated oral tongue sites are best described by placing period and cohort effects on the initiation rate. HPV-related and non-oral-tongue HPV-unrelated cancers have similar promotion rates, suggesting similar tumorigenesis dynamics once initiated. Estimates of promotion rates at oral tongue sites are lower, corresponding to a longer sojourn time; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis of an etiology distinct from HPV or alcohol and tobacco use. Finally, for the three subsite groups, men have higher initiation rates than women of the same race, and black people have higher promotion than white people of the same sex. These differences explain part of the racial and sex differences in OSCC incidence.

Additionally, autoinoculation adds considerable complexity to the form of R0.

Yet, definition of the intrinsic molecular differences between male and female multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in bone is lacking. This study assessed sex-linked differences in MSC differentiation in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Analysis of tibiae showed that female mice had lower bone volume fraction and higher adipocyte content in the bone marrow compared to age-matched males. While both males and females lost bone mass in early aging, the rate of loss was higher in males. Similar expression of bone- and adipocyte-related genes was seen in males and females at 3 and 9 months, while at 6 months, females exhibited a twofold greater expression of these genes. Under osteogenic culture conditions, bone marrow MSCs from female 3- and 6-month-old mice expressed similar levels of bone-related genes, but significantly greater levels of adipocyte-related genes, than male MSCs. Female MSCs also responded to rosiglitazone-induced suppression of osteogenesis at a 5-fold lower (10 nM) concentration than male MSCs. Female MSCs grown in estrogen-stripped medium showed similar responses to rosiglitazone as MSCs grown in serum containing estrogen. MSCs from female mice that had undergone ovariectomy before sexual maturity also were sensitive to rosiglitazone-induced effects on osteogenesis. These results suggest that female MSCs are more sensitive to modulation of differentiation by PPARγ and that these differences are intrinsic to the sex of the animal from which the MSCs came.

However, bromodomain-mediated mechanisms that couple histone acetylation to transcription in lymphopoiesis and govern mature lymphocyte mitogenesis are poorly understood. Brd2, a transcriptional coregulator that contains dual bromodomains and an extraterminal domain (the BET family), couples chromatin to cell-cycle progression. We reported previously the first functional characterization of a BET protein as an effector of mammalian mitogenic signal transduction: Eμ-Brd2 Tg mice develop ""activated B cell"" diffuse large B cell lymphoma. No other animal models exist for genetic or lentiviral expression of BET proteins, hampering testing of novel anti-BET anticancer drugs, such as JQ1. We transduced HSCs with Brd2 lentivirus and reconstituted recipient mice to test the hypothesis that Brd2 regulates hematopoiesis in BM and mitogenesis in the periphery. Forced expression of Brd2 provides an expansion advantage to the donor-derived B cell compartment in BM and increases mature B cell mitogenic responsiveness in vitro. Brd2 binds the cyclin A promoter in B cells, shown by ChIP, and increases cyclin A mRNA and protein levels, and S-phase progression in vitro in mitogen-stimulated primary B cells, but not T cells, reinforcing results from Eμ-Brd2 mice. The small molecule BET inhibitor JQ1 reduces B cell mitogenesis, consistent with the interpretation that BET inhibitors are antiproliferative. Brd2-specific knockdown experiments show that Brd2 is also required for hematopoiesis. We conclude that Brd2 plays a critical, independent role in regulation of mitogenic response genes, particularly cyclin A, in B cells.

However, proteins responsible for translating the histone acetylation code into an orchestrated proinflammatory cytokine response remain poorly characterized. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins are ""readers"" of histone acetylation marks, with demonstrated roles in gene transcription, but the ability of BET proteins to coordinate the response of inflammatory cytokine genes through translation of histone marks is unknown. We hypothesize that members of the BET family of dual bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulators directly control inflammatory genes. We examined the genetic model of brd2 lo mice, a BET protein hypomorph, to show that Brd2 is essential for proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Studies that use small interfering RNA knockdown and a small-molecule inhibitor of BET protein binding, JQ1, independently demonstrate BET proteins are critical for macrophage inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we show that Brd2 and Brd4 physically associate with the promoters of inflammatory cytokine genes in macrophages. This association is absent in the presence of BET inhibition by JQ1. Finally, we demonstrate that JQ1 ablates cytokine production in vitro and blunts the ""cytokine storm"" in endotoxemic mice by reducing levels of IL-6 and TNF-α while rescuing mice from LPS-induced death.

Complementary in vivo studies show that obese B cell-null mice have decreased systemic inflammation, inflammatory B- and T-cell cytokines, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR) compared with obese WT mice. Reduced inflammation in obese/insulin resistant B cell-null mice associates with an increased percentage of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs). This increase contrasts with the sharply decreased percentage of Tregs in obese compared with lean WT mice and suggests that B cells may be critical regulators of T-cell functions previously shown to play important roles in IR. We demonstrate that B cells from T2D (but not non-T2D) subjects support proinflammatory T-cell function in obesity/T2D through contact-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, human monocytes increase proinflammatory T-cell cytokines in both T2D and non-T2D analyses. These data support the conclusion that B cells are critical regulators of inflammation in T2D due to their direct ability to promote proinflammatory T-cell function and secrete a proinflammatory cytokine profile.

Given considerable differences in linkage disequilibrium structure between populations of European and African ancestry, the known risk variants may not be informative for risk in African ancestry populations. In a previous fine-mapping investigation of 19 breast cancer loci, we were able to identify SNPs in four regions that better captured risk associations in African American women. In this study of breast cancer in African American women (3016 cases, 2745 controls), we tested an additional 54 novel breast cancer risk variants. Thirty-eight variants (70%) were found to have an association with breast cancer in the same direction as previously reported, with eight (15%) replicating at P < 0.05. Through fine-mapping, in three regions (1q32, 3p24, 10q25), we identified variants that better captured associations with overall breast cancer or estrogen receptor positive disease. We also observed suggestive associations with variants (at P < 5 × 10(-6)) in three separate regions (6q25, 14q13, 22q12) that may represent novel risk variants. Directional consistency of association observed for ∼65-70% of currently known genetic variants for breast cancer in women of African ancestry implies a shared functional common variant at most loci. To validate and enhance the spectrum of alleles that define associations at the known breast cancer risk loci, as well as genome-wide, will require even larger collaborative efforts in women of African ancestry.

Here, using both hormone-sensitive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model systems, we systematically altered EMT transcriptional profiles by manipulating individual BET proteins and found that BRD2 positively regulates EMT, whereas BRD3 and BRD4 repress this program. Knockdown of individual BET proteins revealed independent transcriptional networks that differed from each other and from the small-molecule pan-BET inhibitor JQ1, which previously had been misleadingly asserted to be BRD4-selective. Available small-molecule pan-BET inhibitors, proposed as antiproliferative agents in cancer clinical trials, obscure these biological differences. Transcriptional profiling reveals that individual BET proteins, inhibited separately, engage in and control EMT through unique processes.<b>Visual Overview:</b> http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/16/4/580/F1.large.jpg <i>Mol Cancer Res; 16(4); 580-6. ©2018 AACR</i>.",U01,,,"Breast, NOS",Breast Invasive Carcinoma,RT-PCR,,,,,,,metastasis,,,,,"EMT, breast cancer","Azepines/pharmacology|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects|Female|Gene Expression Profiling/methods|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Nuclear Proteins/genetics|Nuclear Proteins/metabolism|Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics|Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism|RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics|RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism|Transcription Factors/genetics|Transcription Factors/metabolism|Triazoles/pharmacology|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/metabolism","Azepines/pharmacology|Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects|Female|Gene Expression Profiling/methods|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Nuclear Proteins/genetics|Nuclear Proteins/metabolism|Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics|Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism|RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics|RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism|Transcription Factors/genetics|Transcription Factors/metabolism|Triazoles/pharmacology|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/genetics|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/metabolism",transcript program embryogenesi epitheli mesenchym transit emt ensur cellular plastic essenti featur carcinoma progress effector signal transduct bromodomain extratermin bet well suit support plastic function co co repressor mammalian transcriptom hormon sensit tripl neg breast tnbc model system systemat alter emt transcript profil manipul individu bet brd2 posit regul emt wherea brd3 brd4 repress program knockdown individu bet reveal independ transcript network differ small molecul pan bet inhibitor jq1 previous misleadingli assert brd4 select avail small molecul pan bet inhibitor propos antiprolif agent clinic trial obscur biolog differ transcript profil reveal individu bet inhibit separ engag control emt uniqu process visual overview http mcr.aacrjournals.orgcontentmolcanr 4 f1.large.jpg mol 16 580 aacr,CSBC U01 Project Boston University

Little is known about associations by breast cancer subtype or among African American (AA) women, who are disproportionately affected by T2D and estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer. We assessed the relation of T2D to incidence of ER- and ER+ breast cancer in data from the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort of AA women enrolled in 1995 and followed biennially. During 847,934 person-years of follow-up, there were 1,851 incident invasive breast cancers, including 914 ER+ and 468 ER- cases. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute HRs for breast cancer incidence associated with T2D relative to no T2D, controlling for body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders. The HR for T2D relative to no T2D was 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.40] for overall breast cancer incidence, with the increase accounted for by ER- cancer: HRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.80-1.31) for ER+ and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.03-2.00) for ER- cancer. The HR for T2D and ER- breast cancer was highest among nonobese women (1.92; 95% CI, 1.22-3.04). The findings suggest that AA women with T2D are at increased risk of developing ER- breast cancer and that poor metabolic health may be more important than obesity for this subtype. Given the high prevalence of T2D in AA women, the observed association could, in part, explain racial disparities in incidence of ER- breast cancer. <i>Cancer Res; 77(22); 6462-9. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"breast cancer, epidemiology, diabetes, metabolism","Adult|African Americans/statistics & numerical data|Aged|Body Mass Index|Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Comorbidity|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology|Female|Humans|Incidence|Middle Aged|Multivariate Analysis|Proportional Hazards Models|Prospective Studies|Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism|Risk Factors|United States/epidemiology","Adult|African Americans/statistics & numerical data|Aged|Body Mass Index|Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Comorbidity|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology|Female|Humans|Incidence|Middle Aged|Multivariate Analysis|Proportional Hazards Models|Prospective Studies|Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism|Risk Factors|United States/epidemiology",white women type ii diabet t2d estim risk breast littl known breast subtyp among african american aa women disproportion affect t2d estrogen receptor neg er breast relat t2d incid er er breast black women health prospect cohort aa women enrol follow biennial person year follow incid invas breast er er case multivari cox proport hazard model comput hr breast incid t2d rel t2d control bodi mass index bmi confound hr t2d rel t2d confid interv ci 1 1 overal breast incid account er hr ci 0 1 er ci 1 2 er hr t2d er breast highest among nonobes women 1 ci 1 3 find aa women t2d risk er breast poor metabol health import obes subtyp given high preval t2d aa women could part explain racial dispar incid er breast 77 6462 aacr,CSBC U01 Project Boston University

Recent population studies identify cohorts of high body mass index (BMI) subjects with unexpectedly reduced risk for breast and colon cancer, and normal BMI subjects with unexpectedly elevated risk for breast cancer, provoking hard thinking about cellular and molecular mechanisms that most strongly couple obesity to cancer occurrence or progression. Emerging work suggests that abnormal metabolism and its associated chronic inflammation make the difference. Type II diabetes, for example, is a chronic inflammatory disease with specific imbalances in T-cell and myeloid-origin cytokines. Inflammation is elevated systemically, measured through blood biomarkers, and locally in adipose tissue. Here, cytokines and chemokines likely modify tumor microenvironments in dangerous ways. High BMI subjects with low inflammation and less disturbed metabolism appear to have reduced risk for certain obesity-associated cancers, whereas lean or slightly overweight subjects with high inflammation and metabolic abnormalities have elevated risk. This latter phenotype is prevalent among South Asian adults and suggests we are not monitoring certain normal weight adults sufficiently for risks of ""obesity-associated"" cancers. Profiling of patient metabolism and inflammation should accompany measures of body composition when considering cancer risk; the evidence base for these refinements must be extended through new, prospective observational studies. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(5); 267-9. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related article by Iyengar et al., Cancer Prev Res 2017;10(4):235-43</i>.",U01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology|Breast Neoplasms/etiology|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Female|Humans|Inflammation/complications|Inflammation/metabolism|Obesity/complications|Risk Factors,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology|Breast Neoplasms/etiology|Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Female|Humans|Inflammation/complications|Inflammation/metabolism|Obesity/complications|Risk Factors,obes weakli certain obes driven recent popul cohort high bodi mass index bmi subject unexpectedli reduc risk breast colon normal bmi subject unexpectedli elev risk breast provok hard think cellular molecular mechan strongli coupl obes occurr progress emerg work abnorm metabol chronic inflamm make differ type ii diabet exampl chronic inflammatori diseas specif imbal myeloid origin cytokin inflamm elev system measur blood biomark local adipos tissu cytokin chemokin like modifi microenviron danger way high bmi subject low inflamm less disturb metabol appear reduc risk certain obes wherea lean slightli overweight subject high inflamm metabol abnorm elev risk latter phenotyp preval among south asian adult monitor certain normal weight adult suffici risk obes profil patient metabol inflamm accompani measur bodi composit consid risk evid base refin must extend new prospect prev 10 267 aacr see relat articl iyengar et al prev 10 43,CSBC U01 Project Boston University

Small molecule BET inhibitors, such as JQ1, block BET protein binding to acetylated lysines, but lack selectivity within the BET family (Brd2, Brd3, Brd4, Brdt), making it difficult to disentangle contributions of each family member to transcriptional and cellular outcomes. Here, we demonstrate multiple improvements in pancreatic β-cells upon BET inhibition with JQ1 or BET-specific siRNAs. JQ1 (50-400 nM) increases insulin secretion from INS-1 cells in a concentration dependent manner. JQ1 increases insulin content in INS-1 cells, accounting for increased secretion, in both rat and human islets. Higher concentrations of JQ1 decrease intracellular triglyceride stores in INS-1 cells, a result of increased fatty acid oxidation. Specific inhibition of both Brd2 and Brd4 enhances insulin transcription, leading to increased insulin content. Inhibition of Brd2 alone increases fatty acid oxidation. Overlapping yet discrete roles for individual BET proteins in metabolic regulation suggest new isoform-selective BET inhibitors may be useful to treat insulin resistant/diabetic patients. Results imply that cancer and diseases of chronic inflammation or disordered metabolism are related through shared chromatin regulatory mechanisms.

The premise underlying this work is that fluorescent protein (FP) tags are less disruptive to normal processing and function when they are attached post-translationally, because target proteins are allowed to fold properly and reach their final subcellular location before being labeled. We accomplish this post-translational labeling by expressing the target protein fused to a short peptide tag (SpyTag), which is then covalently labeled in situ by controlled expression of an open isopeptide domain (SpyoIPD, a more stable derivative of the SpyCatcher protein) fused to an FP. The formation of a covalent bond between SpyTag and SpyoIPD attaches the FP to the target protein. We demonstrate the general applicability of this strategy by labeling several yeast proteins. Importantly, we show that labeling the membrane protein Pma1 in this manner avoids the mislocalization and growth impairment that occur when Pma1 is genetically fused to an FP. We also demonstrate that this strategy enables a novel approach to spatiotemporal tracking in single cells and we develop a Bayesian analysis to determine the protein's turnover time from such data.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Tracking/methods|Fluorescent Dyes/analysis|Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry|Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism|Protein Engineering/methods|Protein Processing, Post-Translational|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism|Single-Cell Analysis/methods|Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods","Cell Tracking/methods|Fluorescent Dyes/analysis|Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry|Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism|Protein Engineering/methods|Protein Processing, Post-Translational|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism|Single-Cell Analysis/methods|Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods",present novel fluoresc label post translat within live saccharomycescerevisia premis underli work fluoresc fp tag less disrupt normal process function attach post translat target allow fold properli reach final subcellular locat label accomplish post translat label target fuse short peptid tag spytag coval label situ control open isopeptid domain spyoipd stabl deriv spycatch fuse fp format coval bond spytag spyoipd attach fp target gener applic strategi label sever yeast importantli label membran pma1 manner avoid misloc growth impair occur pma1 genet fuse fp strategi enabl novel approach spatiotempor track singl bayesian turnov time data.,Systems Analysis of Phenotypic Switch in Control of Cancer Invasion

Recent research has implicated tumor inflammation as a promoter of metastasis. Myeloid, lymphoid, and mesenchymal cells in the tumor microenvironment promote inflammatory signaling amongst each other and together with cancer cells to modulate sustained inflammation, which may enhance cancer invasiveness. Tumor hypoxia, a state of reduced available oxygen present in the majority of solid tumors, acts as a prognostic factor for a worse outcome and is known to have a role in tumor inflammation through the regulation of inflammatory mediator signals in both cancer and neighboring cells in the microenvironment. Multiple methods to target tumor hypoxia have been developed and tested in clinical trials, and still more are emerging as the impacts of hypoxia become better understood. These strategies include mechanistic inhibition of the hypoxia inducible factor signaling pathway and hypoxia activated pro-drugs, leading to both anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects. This prompts a need for further research on the prevention of hypoxia-mediated inflammation in cancer. Hypoxia-targeting strategies seem to have the most potential for therapeutic benefit when combined with traditional chemotherapy agents. This paper will serve to summarize the role of the inflammatory response in metastasis, to discuss how hypoxia can enable or enhance inflammatory signaling, and to review established and emerging strategies to target the hypoxia-inflammation-metastasis axis.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,metastasis,,,,,,,,metastasi lead caus relat death recent research implic inflamm promot metastasi myeloid lymphoid mesenchym microenviron promot inflammatori signal amongst togeth modul sustain inflamm enhanc invas hypoxia state reduc avail oxygen present major solid act prognost factor wors outcom known role inflamm regul inflammatori mediat signal neighbor microenviron multipl target hypoxia test clinic trial still emerg impact hypoxia becom better understood strategi mechanist inhibit hypoxia induc factor signal pathway hypoxia pro drug lead anti anti inflammatori prompt need research prevent hypoxia mediat inflamm hypoxia target strategi seem therapeut benefit combin tradit chemotherapi agent paper serv summar role inflammatori respons metastasi discuss hypoxia enabl enhanc inflammatori signal review establish emerg strategi target hypoxia inflamm metastasi axis.,Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences Oncology Center (PS-OC)

The latter can involve movement by blebbing or other cyclic shape changes, and both highly-simplified and more realistic models of these modes have been studied previously. Herein we study swimming that is driven by membrane tension gradients that arise from flows in the actin cortex underlying the membrane, and does not involve imposed cyclic shape changes.

We then analyze the effects of spatial variation in other membrane properties, and how they interact with tension gradients to determine the shape. We also study the effect of fluid-cell interactions and show how tension leads to cell movement, how the balance between tension gradients and a variable bending modulus determine the shape and direction of movement, and how the efficiency of movement depends on the properties of the fluid and the distribution of tension and bending modulus in the membrane.",U54,,,not reported,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,microenvironment,,,,,,,,recent research motil adapt mode propuls mechan properti environ find crawl environ swim latter involv movement bleb cyclic shape chang highli simplifi realist model mode previous herein swim driven membran tension gradient aris flow actin cortex underli membran involv impos cyclic shape chang gradient lead number differ characterist shape first object understand differ distribut membran tension influenc shape inviscid quiescent fluid analyz spatial variat membran properti interact tension gradient shape fluid interact tension lead movement balanc tension gradient variabl bend modulu shape direct movement effici movement depend properti fluid distribut tension bend modulu membrane.,Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics

Hierarchical taxonomies are ubiquitous, ranging from the classification of organisms to the file system on a computer. Characterizing the typical distribution of items within taxonomic categories is an important question with applications in many disciplines. Ecologists have long sought to account for the patterns observed in species-abundance distributions (the number of individuals per species found in some sample), and computer scientists study the distribution of files per directory. Is there a universal statistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each category in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large, real-world datasets - including items lost and found on the New York City transit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome - and discover such an underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that randomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items and the total number of categories is quite successful in reproducing the observed abundance distributions. This result may shed light on patterns in species-abundance distributions long observed in ecology. The model also predicts the number of taxonomic categories that remain unrepresented in a finite sample.",U54,,,not reported,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Databases, Factual|Models, Biological|Statistical Distributions","Databases, Factual|Models, Biological|Statistical Distributions",taxonomi standard framework classifi organ item categori hierarch taxonomi ubiquit rang classif organ file system comput character typic distribut item within taxonom categori import question applic mani disciplin ecologist long sought account pattern speci abund distribut number individu per speci sampl comput scientist distribut file per directori univers statist distribut describ mani item typic categori larg taxonomi analyz wide array larg real world dataset item lost new york citi transit system librari book bacteri microbiom discov underli common simpl non parametr branch model randomli categor item take input total number item total number categori quit success reproduc abund distribut shed light pattern speci abund distribut long ecolog model predict number taxonom categori remain unrepres finit sample.,Columbia University Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity

Emerging critical opinion considers unresolved inflammation and abnormal metabolism separately from obesity; settings where they do not co-occur can inform disease mechanism. In breast cancer, the tumor microenvironment is often infiltrated with T effector and T regulatory cells programmed by metabolic signaling. The pathways by which tumor cells evade immune surveillance, immune therapies, and take advantage of antitumor immunity are poorly understood, but likely depend on metabolic inflammation in the microenvironment. Immune functions are abnormal in metabolic disease, and lessons learned from preclinical studies in lean and metabolically normal environments may not translate to patients with obesity and metabolic disease. This problem is made more urgent by the rising incidence of breast cancer among women who are not obese but who have metabolic disease and associated inflammation, a phenotype common in Asia. The somatic BET proteins, comprising BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, are new critical regulators of metabolism, coactivate transcription of genes that encode proinflammatory cytokines in immune cell subsets infiltrating the microenvironment, and could be important targets in breast cancer immunotherapy. These transcriptional coregulators are well known to regulate tumor cell progression, but only recently identified as critical for metabolism, metastasis, and expression of immune checkpoint molecules.

Although MPE research has been commonly applied to investigating breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, its methodology can be used to study most diseases. Recent successes in MPE studies include: (1) the development of new statistical methods to address etiologic heterogeneity; (2) the enhancement of causal inference; (3) the identification of previously unknown exposure-subtype disease associations; and (4) better understanding of the role of lifestyle/behavioral factors on modifying prognosis according to disease subtype. Central challenges to MPE include the relative lack of transdisciplinary experts, educational programs, and forums to discuss issues related to the advancement of the field.

As a product of molecular evolution that sought to maximize replicative potential, DNA's unidirectional replication poses a mystery since symmetric bidirectional self-replicators obviously would replicate faster than unidirectional self-replicators and hence would have been evolutionarily more successful. Here we carefully examine the physico-chemical requirements for evolutionarily successful primordial self-replicators and theoretically show that at low monomer concentrations that possibly prevailed in the primordial oceans, asymmetric unidirectional self-replicators would have an evolutionary advantage over bidirectional self-replicators. The competing requirements of low and high kinetic barriers for formation and long lifetime of inter-strand bonds respectively are simultaneously satisfied through asymmetric kinetic influence of inter-strand bonds, resulting in evolutionarily successful unidirectional self-replicators.

In order to investigate the role of IDH mutations in immune response, we created a syngeneic pair mouse model for mutant IDH1 (muIDH1) and wtIDH1 gliomas and demonstrated that muIDH1 mice showed many molecular and clinical similarities to muIDH1 human gliomas, including a 100-fold higher concentration of 2-hydroxygluratate (2-HG), longer survival time, and higher CpG methylation compared with wtIDH1. Also, we showed that IDH1 mutations caused down-regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, resulting in repression of the tumor-associated immune system.

Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2<sup>+/R367Q</sup> mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts.

Here, we present a mixture piecewise linear Bayesian hierarchical model, which takes into account both population heterogeneity and nonlinear relationships between biomarkers and time. Simulation results show that our method was able to classify subjects according to their patterns of treatment response with greater than 80% accuracy in the three scenarios tested.

Analysis results suggest that the longitudinal tumor burden trajectories in multiple myeloma patients are heterogeneous and nonlinear, even among patients assigned to the same treatment cohort.

We hypothesized that information about tumor differentiation of individual cancers could be derived objectively from cancer gene expression data, and would allow creation of a cancer phylogenetic framework that would correlate with clinical, histologic and molecular characteristics of the cancers, as well as predict prognosis. Here we utilized mRNA expression data from 4,413 patient samples with 7 diverse cancer histologies to explore the utility of ordering samples by their distance in gene expression from that of stem cells. A differentiation baseline was obtained by including expression data of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) for solid tumors, and of hESC and CD34+ cells for liquid tumors. We found that the correlation distance (the degree of similarity) between the gene expression profile of a tumor sample and that of stem cells orients cancers in a clinically coherent fashion. For all histologies analyzed (including carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic malignancies), patients with cancers with gene expression patterns most similar to that of stem cells had poorer overall survival. We also found that the genes in all undifferentiated cancers of diverse histologies that were most differentially expressed were associated with up-regulation of specific oncogenes and down-regulation of specific tumor suppressor genes. Thus, a stem cell-oriented phylogeny of cancers allows for the derivation of a novel cancer gene expression signature found in all undifferentiated forms of diverse cancer histologies, that is competitive in predicting overall survival in cancer patients compared to previously published prediction models, and is coherent in that gene expression was associated with up-regulation of specific oncogenes and down-regulation of specific tumor suppressor genes associated with regulation of the multicellular state.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Differentiation/genetics|Down-Regulation/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics|Humans|Neoplasms/genetics|Oncogenes/genetics|Stem Cells/metabolism|Transcriptome/genetics|Up-Regulation/genetics","Cell Differentiation/genetics|Down-Regulation/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics|Humans|Neoplasms/genetics|Oncogenes/genetics|Stem Cells/metabolism|Transcriptome/genetics|Up-Regulation/genetics",degre histolog cellular differenti prognosi subject hypothes inform differenti individu could deriv object would allow creation phylogenet framework would correl clinic histolog molecular characterist well predict prognosi util mrna patient sampl divers histolog explor util order sampl distanc stem differenti baselin obtain human embryon stem hesc human mesenchym stem hmsc solid hesc cd34 liquid correl distanc degre similar profil sampl stem orient clinic coher fashion histolog analyz carcinoma sarcoma hematolog malign patient pattern similar stem poorer overal surviv undifferenti divers histolog differenti regul specif oncogen regul specif suppressor thu stem orient phylogeni allow deriv novel signatur undifferenti form divers histolog competit predict overal surviv patient previous publish predict model coher regul specif oncogen regul specif suppressor regul multicellular state.,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Physical Sciences-Oncology Center

Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Baseline information and standard grading scales were evaluated: age, sex, Hunt Hess grade, modified Fisher Scale (mFS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). An unsupervised approach applying random kernels was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (Partial Least Squares, linear and kernel Support Vector Machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.58. Combined demographics and grading scales: AUC 0.60.

We hypothesized that in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of ASCT would be associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, collectively termed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (TMN), and other adverse outcomes. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing on pre- and post-ASCT samples from 12 patients who developed TMN after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma and targeted sequencing on cryopreserved aliquots of autologous stem-cell products from 401 patients who underwent ASCT for non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2003 and 2010. We assessed the effect of CHIP at the time of ASCT on subsequent outcomes, including TMN, cause-specific mortality, and overall survival. Results For six of 12 patients in the exome sequencing cohort, mutations found in the TMN specimen were also detectable in the pre-ASCT specimen. In the targeted sequencing cohort, 120 patients (29.9%) had CHIP at the time of ASCT, which was associated with an increased rate of TMN (10-year cumulative incidence, 14.1% v 4.3% for those with and without CHIP, respectively; P = .002). Patients with CHIP had significantly inferior overall survival compared with those without CHIP (10-year overall survival, 30.4% v 60.9%, respectively; P < .001), including increased risk of death from TMN and cardiovascular disease.

This requirement is met by the overexpression of glutaminase C (GAC), which catalyzes the first step in glutamine metabolism and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. The small molecule CB-839 was reported to be more potent than other allosteric GAC inhibitors, including the parent compound bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl (BPTES), and is in clinical trials. Recently, we described the synthesis of BPTES analogs having distinct saturated heterocyclic cores as a replacement for the flexible chain moiety, with improved microsomal stability relative to CB-839 and BPTES. Here, we show that one of these new compounds, UPGL00004, like CB-839, more potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of GAC, compared with BPTES. We also compare the abilities of UPGL00004, CB-839, and BPTES to directly bind to recombinant GAC and demonstrate that UPGL00004 has a similar binding affinity as CB-839 for GAC. We also show that UPGL00004 potently inhibits the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells, as well as tumor growth when combined with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab. Finally, we compare the X-ray crystal structures for UPGL00004 and CB-839 bound to GAC, verifying that UPGL00004 occupies the same binding site as CB-839 or BPTES and that all three inhibitors regulate the enzymatic activity of GAC via a similar allosteric mechanism. These results provide insights regarding the potency of these inhibitors that will be useful in designing novel small-molecules that target a key enzyme in cancer cell metabolism.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allosteric Site/drug effects|Amino Acid Substitution|Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry|Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism|Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology|Benzeneacetamides/chemistry|Benzeneacetamides/metabolism|Benzeneacetamides/pharmacology|Binding, Competitive|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Crystallography, X-Ray|Drug Resistance, Multiple|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm|Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry|Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism|Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology|Glutaminase/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutaminase/chemistry|Glutaminase/genetics|Glutaminase/metabolism|Glutamine/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutamine/chemistry|Glutamine/metabolism|Humans|Hydrogen Bonding|Models, Molecular|Molecular Conformation|Mutation|Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors|Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Recombinant Proteins/chemistry|Recombinant Proteins/metabolism|Sulfides/chemistry|Sulfides/metabolism|Sulfides/pharmacology|Thiadiazoles/chemistry|Thiadiazoles/metabolism|Thiadiazoles/pharmacology|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/pathology","Allosteric Site/drug effects|Amino Acid Substitution|Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry|Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism|Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology|Benzeneacetamides/chemistry|Benzeneacetamides/metabolism|Benzeneacetamides/pharmacology|Binding, Competitive|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Proliferation/drug effects|Crystallography, X-Ray|Drug Resistance, Multiple|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm|Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry|Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism|Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology|Glutaminase/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutaminase/chemistry|Glutaminase/genetics|Glutaminase/metabolism|Glutamine/antagonists & inhibitors|Glutamine/chemistry|Glutamine/metabolism|Humans|Hydrogen Bonding|Models, Molecular|Molecular Conformation|Mutation|Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors|Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry|Neoplasm Proteins/genetics|Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism|Recombinant Proteins/chemistry|Recombinant Proteins/metabolism|Sulfides/chemistry|Sulfides/metabolism|Sulfides/pharmacology|Thiadiazoles/chemistry|Thiadiazoles/metabolism|Thiadiazoles/pharmacology|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/pathology","alter glycolyt flux warburg caus prolifer reli upon elev glutamin metabol ""glutamin addict requir met overexpress glutaminas c gac catalyz first step glutamin metabol therefor repres therapeut target small molecul cb potent alloster gac inhibitor parent compound bi phenylacetamido thiadiazol yl)ethyl bpte clinic trial recent describ synthesi bpte analog distinct satur heterocycl core replac flexibl chain moieti improv microsom stabil rel cb bpte new compound upgl00004 like cb potent inhibit enzymat gac bpte abil upgl00004 cb bpte directli bind recombin gac upgl00004 similar bind affin cb gac upgl00004 potent inhibit growth tripl neg breast well growth combin anti vascular endotheli growth factor antibodi bevacizumab final x ray crystal structur upgl00004 cb bound gac verifi upgl00004 occupi bind site cb bpte three inhibitor regul enzymat gac via similar alloster mechan provid insight regard potenc inhibitor design novel small molecul target key enzym metabolism.",Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism

Specifically, in desmoplastic carcinomas such as those of the breast, aligned collagen tracks provide contact guidance cues for directed cancer cell invasion. Yet, the evolving dynamics of this process of invasion remains poorly understood, in part due to difficulties in continuously capturing both spatial and temporal heterogeneity and progression to invasion in experimental systems. Therefore, to study the local invasion process from cell dense clusters into aligned collagen architectures found in solid tumors, we developed a novel engineered 3D invasion platform that integrates an aligned collagen matrix with a cell dense tumor-like plug. Using multiphoton microscopy and quantitative analysis of cell motility, we track the invasion of cancer cells from cell-dense bulk clusters into the pre-aligned 3D matrix, and define the temporal evolution of the advancing invasion fronts over several days. This enables us to identify and probe cell dynamics in key regions of interest: behind, at, and beyond the edge of the invading lesion at distinct time points. Analysis of single cell migration identifies significant spatial heterogeneity in migration behavior between cells in the highly cell-dense region behind the leading edge of the invasion front and cells at and beyond the leading edge. Moreover, temporal variations in motility and directionality are also observed between cells within the cell-dense tumor-like plug and the leading invasive edge as its boundary extends into the anisotropic collagen over time. Furthermore, experimental results combined with mathematical modeling demonstrate that in addition to contact guidance, physical crowding of cells is a key regulating factor orchestrating variability in single cell migration during invasion into anisotropic ECM. Thus, our novel platform enables us to capture spatio-temporal dynamics of cell behavior behind, at, and beyond the invasive front and reveals heterogeneous, local interactions that lead to the emergence and maintenance of the advancing front.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinoma/metabolism|Carcinoma/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement/physiology|Collagen/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/pathology|Female|Humans|Imaging, Three-Dimensional|Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton|Models, Biological|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Neoplasm Invasiveness/physiopathology|Systems Biology","Breast Neoplasms/metabolism|Breast Neoplasms/pathology|Carcinoma/metabolism|Carcinoma/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement/physiology|Collagen/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Extracellular Matrix/pathology|Female|Humans|Imaging, Three-Dimensional|Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton|Models, Biological|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Neoplasm Invasiveness/physiopathology|Systems Biology",carcinoma frequent expand invad confin lesion multicellular cluster stroma path metastasi often effici dictat architectur composit microenviron specif desmoplast carcinoma breast align collagen track provid contact guidanc cue direct invas yet evolv dynam process invas remain poorli understood part due difficulti continu captur spatial tempor heterogen progress invas experiment system therefor local invas process dens cluster align collagen architectur solid novel engin 3d invas platform integr align collagen matrix dens like plug multiphoton microscopi quantit motil track invas dens bulk cluster pre align 3d matrix defin tempor evolut advanc invas front sever day enabl us probe dynam key region interest behind beyond edg invad lesion distinct time point singl migrat spatial heterogen migrat behavior highli dens region behind lead edg invas front beyond lead edg moreov tempor variat motil direction within dens like plug lead invas edg boundari extend anisotrop collagen time furthermor experiment combin mathemat model addit contact guidanc physic crowd key regul factor orchestr variabl singl migrat invas anisotrop ecm thu novel platform enabl us captur spatio tempor dynam behavior behind beyond invas front reveal heterogen local interact lead emerg mainten advanc front.,Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics

Based on the qualified scRNA-seq libraries that we made, we found that 1302 genes were differentially expressed between these two EC phenotypes. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and heat map-based hierarchical clustering separated the cancerous versus control ECs as two distinctive clusters, and MetaCore disease biomarker analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes are highly correlated with breast neoplasm diseases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis software (GSEA) enriched these genes to extracellular matrix (ECM) signal pathways and highlighted 127 ECM-associated genes.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) analysis, by conventional pathologic methods, is predictive but is insufficiently precise for clinical application.

Given that CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) promote antitumor immunity, whereas CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages impair immunity, we hypothesized that quantification and spatial analysis of macrophages and CTLs would correlate with clinical outcome.

CTLs were further in proximity from proliferating SOX10<sup>+</sup> melanoma cells than nonproliferating ones (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). In 64 patients with known cause of death, we found that high CTL and low macrophage density in the stroma (<i>P</i> = 0.0038 and <i>P</i> = 0.0006, respectively) correlated with disease-specific survival (DSS), but the correlation was less significant for CTL and macrophage density in the tumor (<i>P</i> = 0.0147 and <i>P</i> = 0.0426, respectively).

Our molecular dynamics simulations are suggested by single-molecule studies of protein-DNA interactions. We consider univalent salt concentrations spanning roughly a 1000-fold range, together with various concentrations of excess ligands in solution. To reveal the ionic effects on unbinding kinetics of spontaneous and facilitated dissociation mechanisms, we treat electrostatic interactions both at a Debye-Hückel (DH) (or implicit ions, i.e., use of an electrostatic potential with a prescribed decay length) level and by the more precise approach of considering all ionic species explicitly in the simulations. We find that the DH approach systematically overestimates unbinding rates, relative to the calculations where all ion pairs are present explicitly in solution, although many aspects of the two types of calculation are qualitatively similar. For facilitated dissociation (FD) (acceleration of unbinding by free ligands in solution) explicit-ion simulations lead to unbinding at lower free-ligand concentrations. Our simulations predict a variety of FD regimes as a function of free-ligand and ion concentrations; a particularly interesting regime is at intermediate concentrations of ligands where nonelectrostatic binding strength controls FD.

We show that a portion of these animals develop loss of skeletal muscle, loss of adipose tissue, and increased inflammatory markers mirroring the human cachexia syndrome. Using noncachexic and fasted animals as controls, we report a unique cachexia metabolite phenotype that includes the loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) -dependent ketone production by the liver. In this setting, glucocorticoid levels rise and correlate with skeletal muscle degradation and hepatic markers of gluconeogenesis.

Upon exposure to glucose limitation stress, it is known that yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells dephosphorylate the general stress response factor Msn2, leading to its nuclear localization, which in turn activates the expression of many genes. However, the precise dynamics of Msn2 nucleocytoplasmic translocations and whether they are inherited over multiple generations in a stress-dependent manner are not well understood. Tracking Msn2 localization events in yeast lineages grown on a microfluidic chip, here we report how cells modulate the amplitude, duration, frequency, and dynamic pattern of the localization events in response to glucose limitation stress. Single yeast cells were found to modulate the amplitude and frequency of Msn2 nuclear localization, but not its duration. Moreover, the Msn2 localization frequency was epigenetically inherited in descendants of mother cells, leading to a decrease in cell-to-cell variation in localization frequency. An analysis of the time dynamic patterns of nuclear localizations between genealogically related cell pairs using an information theory approach found that the magnitude of pattern similarity increased with stress intensity and was strongly inherited by the descendant cells at the highest stress level.

This has led to a renewed interest in analytic methodologies including use of the 'von Foerster equation' for predicting population growth and cell age distributions. Here we discuss how some of the most popular implementations of this machinery assume a strong condition on the ergodicity of the cell cycle duration ensemble. We show that one common definition for the term ergodicity, 'a single individual observed over many generations recapitulates the behavior of the entire ensemble' is implied by the other, 'the probability of observing any state is conserved across time and over all individuals' in an ensemble with a fixed number of individuals but that this is not true when the ensemble is growing. We further explore the impact of generational correlations between cell cycle durations on the population growth rate. Finally, we explore the 'growth rate gain'-the phenomenon that variations in the cell cycle duration leads to an improved population-level growth rate-in this context.

To study the mechanism of radioresistance, the effects of <i>SMAD4</i> loss on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy were determined by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, we measured radioresistance by clonogenic survival assay after treatment with autophagy inhibitor (Chloroquine) and ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl-l-cysteine) in <i>SMAD4</i>-depleted pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, the effects of <i>SMAD4</i> on radioresistance were also confirmed in an orthotopic tumor model derived from <i>SMAD4</i>-depleted Panc-1 cells.<b>Results:</b><i>SMAD4</i>-depleted pancreatic cancer cells were more resistant to radiotherapy based on clonogenic survival assay. Overexpression of wild-type SMAD4 in <i>SMAD4</i>-mutant cells rescued their radiosensitivity.

Finally, <i>SMAD4</i> depletion induced <i>in vivo</i> radioresistance in Panc-1-derived orthotopic tumor model (<i>P</i> = 0.038).

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the roles of CAFs in modulating tumor vasculature, chemoresistance, and disease progression. Here, we found that CAFs upregulated the lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) gene in microvascular endothelial cells (MECs) and that LPP expression levels in intratumoral MECs correlated with survival and chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, LPP increased focal adhesion and stress fiber formation to promote endothelial cell motility and permeability. siRNA-mediated LPP silencing in ovarian tumor-bearing mice improved paclitaxel delivery to cancer cells by decreasing intratumoral microvessel leakiness. Further studies showed that CAFs regulate endothelial LPP via a calcium-dependent signaling pathway involving microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (MFAP5), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ERK, and LPP. Thus, our findings suggest that targeting endothelial LPP enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.

However, even effective therapies fail as cancer cells deploy a wide range of resistance strategies. We propose that evolutionary dynamics ultimately determine survival and proliferation of resistant cells. Therefore, evolutionary strategies should be used with conventional therapies to delay or prevent resistance. Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we applied antiproliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compared a continuous maximum-tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control via competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Continuous treatment cured mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence was inevitable. We identified two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors. These findings offer potential modifications to treatment regimens that may improve outcomes and reduce resistance and recurrence.<b>Significance:</b> By using drug dose modulation or treatment vacations, adaptive therapy strategies control the emergence of tumor drug resistance by spatially suppressing less fit resistant populations in favor of treatment sensitive ones. <i>Cancer Res; 78(8); 2127-39. ©2018 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage|Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use|Biological Evolution|Computational Biology|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Maximum Tolerated Dose|Neoplasms/drug therapy|Neoplasms/pathology|Phenotype|Recurrence","Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage|Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use|Biological Evolution|Computational Biology|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm|Humans|MCF-7 Cells|Maximum Tolerated Dose|Neoplasms/drug therapy|Neoplasms/pathology|Phenotype|Recurrence",treatment advanc benefit new agent supplement bypass convent therapi even therapi fail deploy wide rang resist strategi propos evolutionari dynam ultim surviv prolifer resist therefor evolutionari strategi convent therapi delay prevent resist agent base framework model spatial competit among sensit resist popul appli antiprolif drug treatment vari ratio sensit resist continu maximum toler dose schedul adapt schedul aim control via competit sensit resist continu treatment cure mostli sensit resist recurr inevit adapt strategi control heterogen dose modul control less drug vacat orient schedul control invas find offer modif treatment regimen improv outcom reduc resist recurr drug dose modul treatment vacat adapt therapi strategi control emerg drug resist spatial suppress less fit resist popul favor treatment sensit 78 2127 aacr,H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute

Increased hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in the stroma of primary tumors promotes activation of oncogenic signaling pathways that impact tumor initiation, growth, and invasion. Carcinoma cell synthesis and assembly of HA-rich pericellular matrices induces a stromal-independent phenotype, which is associated with cancer progression. Although the pro-tumorigenic role of stromal HA is well established, a novel but unexplored hypothesis is that carcinoma cell-associated HA pericellular matrices promote metastasis of circulating tumor cells. Here, we report the development of an in vitro assay that employs microfluidic techniques to directly measure the importance of an HA-rich pericellular matrix in the entry of carcinoma cells into ectopic sites. This model provides the capability to visualize specific steps in metastasis, which is difficult using animal models. The results show that the presence of a HA-rich pericellular matrix correlates to the invasive and metastatic potential of breast carcinoma cells. Furthermore, enzymatic removal or pharmacologic inhibition of HA synthesis significantly inhibits carcinoma cell extravasation and invasion in this model system.

Most GBM patients succumb to the disease less than 1 year after diagnosis due to the highly invasive nature of the tumor, which prevents complete surgical resection and gives rise to tumor recurrence. The invasive phenotype also confers radioresistant and chemoresistant properties to the tumor cells; therefore, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutics that target drivers of GBM invasion. Amplification of EGFR is observed in over 50% of GBM tumors, of which half concurrently overexpress the variant EGFRvIII, and expression of both receptors confers a worse prognosis. EGFR and EGFRvIII cooperate to promote tumor progression and invasion, in part, through activation of the Stat signaling pathway. Here, it is reported that EGFRvIII activates Stat5 and GBM invasion by inducing the expression of a previously established mediator of glioma cell invasion and survival: fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14). EGFRvIII-mediated induction of Fn14 expression is Stat5 dependent and requires activation of Src, whereas EGFR regulation of Fn14 is dependent upon Src-MEK/ERK-Stat3 activation. Notably, treatment of EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells with the FDA-approved Stat5 inhibitor pimozide blocked Stat5 phosphorylation, Fn14 expression, and cell migration and survival. Because EGFR inhibitors display limited therapeutic efficacy in GBM patients, the EGFRvIII-Stat5-Fn14 signaling pathway represents a node of vulnerability in the invasive GBM cell populations.<b>Implications:</b> Targeting critical effectors in the EGFRvIII-Stat5-Fn14 pathway may limit GBM tumor dispersion, mitigate therapeutic resistance, and increase survival. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 16(7); 1185-95. ©2018 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement/genetics|Cell Proliferation/genetics|Cell Survival/genetics|ErbB Receptors/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/pathology|Glioblastoma/therapy|Humans|Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Phosphorylation|STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics|STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics|Signal Transduction/genetics|TWEAK Receptor/genetics","Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement/genetics|Cell Proliferation/genetics|Cell Survival/genetics|ErbB Receptors/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/pathology|Glioblastoma/therapy|Humans|Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Phosphorylation|STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics|STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics|Signal Transduction/genetics|TWEAK Receptor/genetics",glioblastoma multiform gbm common brain malign adult gbm patient succumb diseas less year diagnosi due highli invas natur prevent complet surgic resect give rise recurr invas phenotyp confer radioresist chemoresist properti therefor critic need new therapeut target driver gbm invas amplif egfr gbm half concurr overexpress variant egfrviii receptor confer wors prognosi egfr egfrviii cooper promot progress invas part stat signal pathway egfrviii stat5 gbm invas induc previous establish mediat glioma invas surviv fibroblast growth factor induc (fn14 egfrviii mediat induct fn14 stat5 depend requir src wherea egfr regul fn14 depend upon src mekerk stat3 notabl treatment egfrviii gbm fda approv stat5 inhibitor pimozid block stat5 phosphoryl fn14 migrat surviv egfr inhibitor display limit therapeut efficaci gbm patient egfrviii stat5 fn14 signal pathway repres node vulner invas gbm popul implic target critic effector egfrviii stat5 fn14 pathway limit gbm dispers mitig therapeut resist surviv mol 16 1185 aacr,MIT Mayo Physical Sciences Center for Drug Distribution and Drug Efficacy in Brain Tumors

We find a higher (lower) number of domains at lower (higher) ionic strengths and stretching forces, in accord with experimental observations. We use our model to study the effect of an immobile point defect on the DNA contour that allows a localized kink. The degree of the kink is controlled by the defect size, such that a larger defect further reduces the bending energy of the defect-facilitated kinked end loop. We find that a defect can spatially pin a plectoneme domain via nucleation of a kinked end loop, in accord with experiments and simulations.

Lamin A is a key intermediate filament component of the nuclear lamina that is downregulated during granulopoiesis. When elevated, lamin A restricts nuclear squeezing through rigid confinements. To determine if the low lamin A expression by leukocyte nuclei is critical for their exceptional squeezing ability through endothelial barriers, we overexpressed this protein in granulocyte-like differentiated HL-60 cells. A 10-fold higher lamin A expression did not interfere with chemokinetic motility of these granulocytes on immobilized CXCL1. Furthermore, these lamin A high leukocytes exhibited normal chemotaxis toward CXCL1 determined in large pore transwell barriers, but poorly squeezed through 3 μm pores toward identical CXCL1 gradients. Strikingly, however, these leukocytes successfully completed paracellular TEM across inflamed endothelial monolayers under shear flow, albeit with a small delay in nuclear squeezing into their sub-endothelial pseudopodia. In contrast, CXCR2 mediated granulocyte motility through collagen I barriers was dramatically delayed by lamin A overexpression due to a failure of lamin A high nuclei to translocate into the pseudopodia of the granulocytes. Collectively, our data predict that leukocytes maintain a low lamin A content in their nuclear lamina in order to optimize squeezing through extracellular collagen barriers but can tolerate high lamin A content when crossing the highly adaptable barriers presented by the endothelial cytoskeleton.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Nucleus/chemistry|Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/physiology|Collagen Type I|Extracellular Space|Granulocytes/chemistry|Granulocytes/physiology|HL-60 Cells|Humans|Laminin/chemistry|Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration/physiology","Cell Nucleus/chemistry|Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/physiology|Collagen Type I|Extracellular Space|Granulocytes/chemistry|Granulocytes/physiology|HL-60 Cells|Humans|Laminin/chemistry|Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration/physiology",transendotheli migrat tem lymphocyt neutrophil abil deform nuclei displac endotheli cytoskelet barrier lamin key intermedi filament compon nuclear lamina downregul granulopoiesi elev lamin restrict nuclear squeez rigid confin low lamin leukocyt nuclei critic except squeez abil endotheli barrier overexpress granulocyt like differenti hl fold higher lamin interfer chemokinet motil granulocyt immobil cxcl1 furthermor lamin high leukocyt exhibit normal chemotaxi toward cxcl1 larg pore transwel barrier poorli squeez μm pore toward ident cxcl1 gradient strikingli leukocyt success complet paracellular tem across inflam endotheli monolay shear flow albeit small delay nuclear squeez sub endotheli pseudopodia contrast cxcr2 mediat granulocyt motil collagen barrier dramat delay lamin overexpress due failur lamin high nuclei transloc pseudopodia granulocyt collect predict leukocyt maintain low lamin content nuclear lamina order optim squeez extracellular collagen barrier toler high lamin content cross highli adapt barrier present endotheli cytoskeleton.,Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism

Improving our understanding of the nanoenvironment is crucial because it has been shown to play a critical functional role in the regulation of chemical reactions. Recent progress in partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy enables real-time measurement of higher-order chromatin organization within label-free live cells. Specifically, PWS quantifies the nanoscale variations in mass density (heterogeneity) within the cell.

However, making quantitative predictions with such models often requires parameter estimation from data, raising questions of parameter identifiability and estimability. Even in the case of structural (theoretical) identifiability, imperfect data and the resulting practical unidentifiability of model parameters can make it difficult to infer the desired information, and in some cases, to yield biologically correct inferences and predictions. Here, we examine parameter identifiability and estimability using a case study of two compartmental, ordinary differential equation models of cancer treatment with drugs that are cell cycle-specific (taxol) as well as non-specific (oxaliplatin). We proceed through model building, structural identifiability analysis, parameter estimation, practical identifiability analysis and its biological implications, as well as alternative data collection protocols and experimental designs that render the model identifiable. We use the differential algebra/input-output relationship approach for structural identifiability, and primarily the profile likelihood approach for practical identifiability. Despite the models being structurally identifiable, we show that without consideration of practical identifiability, incorrect cell cycle distributions can be inferred, that would result in suboptimal therapeutic choices. We illustrate the usefulness of estimating practically identifiable combinations (in addition to the more typically considered structurally identifiable combinations) in generating biologically meaningful insights. We also use simulated data to evaluate how the practical identifiability of the model would change under alternative experimental designs. These results highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms rather than purely using parsimony or information criteria/goodness-of-fit to decide model selection questions.

In certain cases of diffusion through porous media, the diffusion coefficient can be variable (i.e. non-constant) due to the complex process of solute displacements within microstructure, since these displacements depend on porosity, internal microstructural geometry, size of the transported particles, chemical nature, and physical interactions between the diffusing substance and the microstructural surroundings. In order to provide a simple and general approach of determining the diffusion coefficient for diffusion through porous media, we have introduced mass release curves as the constitutive curves of diffusion. The mass release curve for a selected direction represents cumulative mass (per surface area) passed in that direction through a small reference volume, in terms of time. We have developed a methodology, based on numerical Finite Element (FE) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods, to determine simple mass release curves of solutes through complex media from which we calculate the diffusion coefficient.

Gain of whole chromosome 7 is an early event in gliomagenesis that occurs in proneural-like precursor cells, which give rise to all isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma transcriptional subtypes. <i>Platelet-derived growth factor A</i> (<i>PDGFA</i>) is one gene on chromosome 7 known to drive gliomagenesis, but, given its location near the end of 7p, there are likely several other genes located along chromosome 7 that select for its increased whole-chromosome copy number within glioblastoma cells. To identify other potential genes that could select for gain of whole chromosome 7, we developed an unbiased bioinformatics approach that identified <i>homeobox A5</i> (<i>HOXA5</i>) as a gene whose expression correlated with gain of chromosome 7 and a more aggressive phenotype of the resulting glioma. High expression of <i>HOXA5</i> in glioblastoma was associated with a proneural gene expression pattern and decreased overall survival in both human proneural and PDGF-driven mouse glioblastoma. Furthermore, <i>HOXA5</i> overexpression promoted cellular proliferation and potentiated radioresistance. We also found enrichment of <i>HOXA5</i> expression in recurrent human and mouse glioblastoma at first recurrence after radiotherapy. Overall, this study implicates <i>HOXA5</i> as a chromosome 7-associated gene-level locus that promotes selection for gain of whole chromosome 7 and an aggressive phenotype in glioblastoma.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animals|Brain Neoplasms/genetics|Brain Neoplasms/mortality|Brain Neoplasms/pathology|Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy|Cell Proliferation|Chromosome Duplication|Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/mortality|Glioblastoma/pathology|Glioblastoma/radiotherapy|Homeodomain Proteins/genetics|Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism|Humans|Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics|Mice|Neoplasm Recurrence, Local|Phosphoproteins/genetics|Phosphoproteins/metabolism|Radiation Tolerance","Animals|Brain Neoplasms/genetics|Brain Neoplasms/mortality|Brain Neoplasms/pathology|Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy|Cell Proliferation|Chromosome Duplication|Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/mortality|Glioblastoma/pathology|Glioblastoma/radiotherapy|Homeodomain Proteins/genetics|Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism|Humans|Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics|Mice|Neoplasm Recurrence, Local|Phosphoproteins/genetics|Phosphoproteins/metabolism|Radiation Tolerance",glioblastoma frequent occur invari fatal primari brain adult vast major glioblastoma character chromosom copi number alter gain whole chromosom loss whole chromosom gain whole chromosom earli event gliomagenesi occur proneur like precursor give rise isocitr dehydrogenas idh wild type glioblastoma transcript subtyp platelet deriv growth factor pdgfa chromosom known drive gliomagenesi given locat near end 7p like sever locat along chromosom select whole chromosom copi number within glioblastoma could select gain whole chromosom unbias bioinformat approach homeobox a5 hoxa5 whose correl gain chromosom aggress phenotyp glioma high hoxa5 glioblastoma proneur pattern decreas overal surviv human proneur pdgf driven mous glioblastoma furthermor hoxa5 overexpress promot cellular prolifer radioresist enrich hoxa5 recurr human mous glioblastoma first recurr radiotherapi overal implic hoxa5 chromosom locu promot select gain whole chromosom aggress phenotyp glioblastoma.,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Physical Sciences-Oncology Center

We quantify the binding efficacy of the ligand-coated-particle in terms of its multivalency, binding free-energy landscape, and the losses in the configurational entropies. We show that 1) the binding avidity for particle sizes less than 350 nm is set by the competition between the enthalpic and entropic contributions, whereas that for sizes above 350 nm is dominated by the enthalpy of binding; 2) anisotropic particles display higher levels of multivalent binding compared to those of spherical particles; and 3) variations in ligand composition can alter binding avidity without altering the average multivalency.

Survivin is highly expressed in a variety of cancers but has very low expression in the corresponding normal tissues, and its expression is often associated with tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. We report that survivin was highly expressed in ovarian cancer and strongly correlated with patient overall poor survival. For the first time, we provide experimental evidence that survivin is involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer cells. Lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase vector mediated BIRC5 gene editing led to the inhibition of EMT by upregulating epithelial cell marker, cytokeratin 7 and downregulating mesenchymal markers: snail2, β-catenin, and vimentin in both ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. Consistent with this molecular approach, pharmacological treatment of ovarian cancer cells using a small molecule survivin inhibitor, YM155 also inhibited EMT in these ovarian cancer cell lines. Overexpression of BIRC5 promoted EMT in SKOV3 cells. Using molecular or pharmacological approaches, we found that cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were significantly inhibited following BIRC5 disruption in both cell lines. Inhibition of BIRC5 expression also sensitized cell responses to paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, loss of BIRC5 expression attenuated TGFβ signaling in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells.

In both physiological and pathophysiological microenvironments, the O<sub>2</sub> concentration is not uniformly distributed but instead follows a gradient that depends on distance from oxygen-carrying blood vessels. Such gradients have a particularly important role in development, tissue regeneration, and tumor growth. In this protocol, we describe how to use our previously reported gelatin-based O<sub>2</sub>-controllable hydrogels that can provide hypoxic microenvironments in vitro. The hydrogel polymeric network is formed via a laccase-mediated cross-linking reaction. In this reaction, laccase catalyzes diferulic acid (diFA) formation to form hydrogels with an O<sub>2</sub>-consuming reaction. Cells, such as cancer or endothelial cells, as well as tumor/tissue grafts, can be encapsulated in the hydrogels during hydrogel formation and then analyzed for cellular responses to 3D hypoxic gradients and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing these responses. Importantly, oxygen gradients can be precisely controlled in standard cell/tissue culture conditions and in vivo.

Using fluorescence microscopy and second harmonic generation, we quantified the collagen densification, fiber alignment, and strains that remain within the tracts after cellular forces are abolished. We explained these observations using a theoretical fiber network model that accounts for the stretch-dependent formation of weak cross-links between nearby fibers. We tested the predictions of our model using shear rheology experiments. Both our model and rheological experiments demonstrated that increasing collagen concentration leads to substantial increases in plasticity. We also considered the effect of permanent elongation of fibers on network plasticity and derived a phase diagram that classifies the dominant mechanisms of plasticity based on the rate and magnitude of deformation and the mechanical properties of individual fibers. Plasticity is caused by the formation of new cross-links if moderate strains are applied at small rates or due to permanent fiber elongation if large strains are applied over short periods.

In the context of gastric cancer (GC), de novo expression of CD44 variant 6 (CD44v6) is found in more than 60% of GCs, but its role in the pathogenesis and progression of this type of cancer remains unclear. Using a combination of media conditioning experiments and decellularized extracellular matrices (ECMs), this study investigates the hypothesis that CD44v6 overexpression enhances tumor cell malignant behavior by modulating stromal cell-mediated ECM remodeling. Our findings indicate that soluble factors secreted by CD44v6 expressing GC cells particularly increase proliferation and myofibroblastic differentiation of adipose stromal cells (ASCs). These changes in ASC phenotype mediate the deposition of fibrotic/desmoplastic ECM that, in turn, stimulates GC proliferation and inhibits GC clustering. Pharmacological inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in tumor cells abrogated matrix-induced changes in tumor cell malignant behavior. Additionally, studies in mice confirmed the pathological relevance of CD44v6 expression and consequential changes in ECM remodeling to gastric tumorigenesis in vivo.

Here, we show that deletion of the genes encoding the two most active enzymes in this pathway, Pip4k2a and Pip4k2b, in the liver of mice causes a large enrichment in lipid droplets and in autophagic vesicles during fasting.

In this study, we seek to understand how Fn and Col I interplay and promote a dysregulated signaling pathway to facilitate tumor progression. Specifically, we investigated the evolution of tumor-conditioned stromal ECM composition, structure, and relaxation. Furthermore, we assessed how evolving Fn-Col I interactions gradually affected pro-angiogenic signaling. Our data first indicate that CAFs initially assembled a strained, viscous, and unfolded Fn matrix. This early altered Fn matrix was later remodeled into a thick Col I-rich matrix that was characteristic of a dense tumor mass. Next, our results suggest that this ECM remodeling was primarily mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This MMP activity caused profound structural and mechanical changes in the developing ECM, which then modified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by CAFs and matrix sequestration.

Microfluidic devices that mimic the narrow interstitial spaces of tissues have emerged as important tools to study cellular dynamics during confined migration, including the consequences of nuclear deformation and nuclear envelope rupture. However, while image acquisition can be automated on motorized microscopes, the analysis of the corresponding time-lapse sequences for nuclear transit through the pores and events such as nuclear envelope rupture currently requires manual analysis. In addition to being highly time-consuming, such manual analysis is susceptible to person-to-person variability. Studies that compare large numbers of cell types and conditions therefore require automated image analysis to achieve sufficiently high throughput. Here, we present an automated image analysis program to register microfluidic constrictions and perform image segmentation to detect individual cell nuclei. The MATLAB program tracks nuclear migration over time and records constriction-transit events, transit times, transit success rates, and nuclear envelope rupture. Such automation reduces the time required to analyze migration experiments from weeks to hours, and removes the variability that arises from different human analysts. Comparison with manual analysis confirmed that both constriction transit and nuclear envelope rupture were detected correctly and reliably, and the automated analysis results closely matched a manual analysis gold standard. Applying the program to specific biological examples, we demonstrate its ability to detect differences in nuclear transit time between cells with different levels of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C, which govern nuclear deformability, and to detect an increase in nuclear envelope rupture duration in cells in which CHMP7, a protein involved in nuclear envelope repair, had been depleted.

Loss of tensional homeostasis in a tissue not only accompanies malignancy but may also contribute to oncogenic transformation. High mechanical stress in solid tumors can impede drug delivery and may additionally drive tumor progression and promote metastasis. Mechanistically, biomechanical forces can drive tumor aggression by inducing a mesenchymal-like switch in transformed cells so that they attain tumor-initiating or stem-like cell properties. Given that cancer stem cells have been linked to metastasis and treatment resistance, this raises the intriguing possibility that the elevated tissue mechanics in tumors could promote their aggression by programming their phenotype toward that exhibited by a stem-like cell.<b>Significance:</b> Recent findings argue that mechanical stress and elevated mechanosignaling foster malignant transformation and metastasis. Prolonged corruption of tissue tension may drive tumor aggression by altering cell fate specification.

Appendage-driven motility is controlled by molecular motors, and analysis of surface motility behavior is complicated by its inherently 3D nature, the speed of which is too fast for confocal microscopy to capture. Here, we combine electromagnetic field computation and statistical image analysis to generate 3D movies close to a surface at 5 ms time resolution using conventional inverted microscopes. We treat each bacterial cell as a spherocylindrical lens and use finite element modeling to solve Maxwell's equations and compute the diffracted light intensities associated with different angular orientations of the bacterium relative to the surface. By performing cross-correlation calculations between measured 2D microscopy images and a library of computed light intensities, we demonstrate that near-surface 3D movies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa translational and rotational motion are possible at high temporal resolution. Comparison between computational reconstructions and detailed hydrodynamic calculations reveals that P. aeruginosa act like low Reynolds number spinning tops with unstable orbits, driven by a flagellum motor with a torque output of ∼2 pN μm.

Unfortunately, these proteins are difficult to directly target using traditional pharmacological strategies, in part due to their lack of obvious binding pockets or allosteric sites. This obstacle has driven a considerable amount of research into pursuing alternative ways to effectively inhibit Ras, examples of which include inducing mislocalization to prevent Ras maturation and inactivating downstream proteins in Ras-driven signaling pathways. Ras proteins are archetypes of a superfamily of small GTPases that play specific roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, nuclear transport, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell cycle progression. Several other superfamily members have also been linked to the control of normal and cancer cell growth and survival. For example, Rap1 has high sequence similarity to Ras, has overlapping binding partners, and has been demonstrated to both oppose and mimic Ras-driven cancer phenotypes. Rap1 plays an important role in cell adhesion and integrin function in a variety of cell types. Mechanistically, Ras and Rap1 cooperate to initiate and sustain ERK signaling, which is activated in many malignancies and is the target of successful therapeutics.

In fact, there are significant disadvantages in using chiral monomers for polymerization, which include enantiomeric cross-inhibition in racemic medium and under-utilization of available resources for self-replication in the primordial environment. Nevertheless, most investigations of homochirality in living systems assume that the individual primordial monomers were chiral prior to the formation of self-replicating polymer and therefore focus on identifying a symmetry-breaking mechanism that might choose one enantiomer over the other in a racemic medium. Within the premise that the extant biomolecules are products of molecular evolution, we ask a related but distinct question: why is an achiral monomer molecule disfavored? Here we identify an evolutionary advantage for molecular evolution to choose chiral over achiral monomers to construct primordial self-replicating polymers. We argue that when polymerization is constrained to proceed in only one direction along the template, as in DNA, evolution favors chiral monomers and homochiral polymers. This evolutionary advantage stems from the ability of a chiral monomer to bond with the template in only one orientation relative to the template monomer, along the direction of polymerization. An achiral monomer, on the other hand, offers more than one possible orientation for bonding with the template monomer, due to the presence of symmetry elements in its structure, which would lead to inhibition of polymerization. We show that the requirement of orientational specificity leads to monomer chirality, by using a known relationship between rotational and reflection symmetry elements, within the constraint that the resultant polymers are helical.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evolution, Chemical|Polymers/chemistry|Stereoisomerism","Evolution, Chemical|Polymers/chemistry|Stereoisomerism",biomolecular homochir univers live system molecular evolutionari dynam led emerg unknown fact disadvantag chiral monom polymer enantiomer cross inhibit racem medium util avail resourc self replic primordi environ nevertheless investig homochir live system assum individu primordi monom chiral prior format self replic polym therefor focu symmetri break mechan might choos enantiom racem medium within premis extant biomolecul product molecular evolut ask relat distinct question achir monom molecul disfavor evolutionari advantag molecular evolut choos chiral achir monom construct primordi self replic polym argu polymer constrain proceed direct along templat dna evolut favor chiral monom homochir polym evolutionari advantag stem abil chiral monom bond templat orient rel templat monom along direct polymer achir monom hand offer possibl orient bond templat monom due presenc symmetri element structur would lead inhibit polymer requir orient specif lead monom chiral known relationship rotat reflect symmetri element within constraint polym helical.,H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute

While much work focuses on the molecular and cellular events that drive breast cancer bone metastasis, it is mostly unclear what role bone extracellular matrix (ECM) properties play in this process. Bone ECM primarily consists of mineralized collagen fibrils, which are composed of non-stoichiometric carbonated apatite (HA) and collagen type I. Reduced bone mineral content is epidemiologically linked with increased risk of bone metastasis. Yet elucidating the potential functional impact of collagen mineralization on breast cancer cells has remained challenging because of a lack of model systems that allow studying tumor cell behavior as a function of physiological, intrafibrillar collagen mineralization. Here, we have developed cell culture substrates composed of mineralized collagen type I fibrils using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. Intrafibrillar HA decreased breast cancer cell adhesion forces and accordingly reduced collagen fiber alignment relative to cells cultured on control collagen. The resulting mineral-mediated changes in collagen network characteristics and mechanosignaling correlated with increased cell motility, but inhibited directed migration of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that physiological mineralization of collagen fibrils reduces tumor cell adhesion with potential functional consequences on skeletal homing of disseminated tumor cells in early stages of breast cancer metastasis.",U54,,,"Breast, NOS",Breast Invasive Carcinoma,,,,,,,,microenvironment,,,,,,,,bone metastasi lead caus death patient breast underli mechan poorli understood much work focus molecular cellular event drive breast bone metastasi mostli unclear role bone extracellular matrix ecm properti play process bone ecm primarili consist miner collagen fibril compos non stoichiometr carbon apatit ha collagen type reduc bone miner content epidemiolog link risk bone metastasi yet elucid function impact collagen miner breast remain challeng lack model system allow behavior function physiolog intrafibrillar collagen miner cultur substrat compos miner collagen type fibril polym induc liquid precursor pilp process intrafibrillar ha decreas breast adhes forc accordingli reduc collagen fiber align rel cultur control collagen miner mediat chang collagen network characterist mechanosign correl motil inhibit direct migrat breast physiolog miner collagen fibril reduc adhes function consequ skelet home dissemin earli stage breast metastasis.,Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism

This ""adaptive,"" time-delayed adhesion requires determinants we showed previously are critical for surface sensing: type IV pili (TFP) and cAMP signaling via the Pil-Chp-TFP system. We show that these surface-adapted cells exhibit damped, coupled out-of-phase oscillations of intracellular cAMP levels and associated TFP activity that persist for multiple generations, whereas surface-naïve cells show uncorrelated cAMP and TFP activity. These correlated cAMP-TFP oscillations, which effectively impart intergenerational memory to cells in a lineage, can be understood in terms of a Turing stochastic model based on the Pil-Chp-TFP framework. Importantly, these cAMP-TFP oscillations create a state characterized by a suppression of TFP motility coordinated across entire lineages and lead to a drastic increase in the number of surface-associated cells with near-zero translational motion.

Unlike starting material obtained by chemical synthesis or direct isolation from natural sources, which can be time consuming and costly to generate, our approach involves precursors derived from renewable sources including wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycoproteins and lipid-linked oligosaccharides from glycoengineered Escherichia coli. Following deglycosylation of these biosynthetic precursors, the resulting microbial oligosaccharides are subjected to a greatly simplified purification scheme followed by structural remodeling using commercially available and recombinantly produced glycosyltransferases including key N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (e.g., GnTI, GnTII, and GnTIV) involved in early remodeling of glycans in the mammalian glycosylation pathway. Using this approach, preparative quantities of hybrid and complex-type N-glycans including asymmetric multi-antennary structures were generated and subsequently used to develop a glycan microarray for high-throughput, fluorescence-based screening of glycan-binding proteins. Taken together, these results confirm our combined synthesis strategy as a new, user-friendly route for supplying chemically defined human glycans simply by combining biosynthetically-derived precursors with enzymatic remodeling.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Escherichia coli/metabolism|Glycosyltransferases/isolation & purification|Glycosyltransferases/metabolism|Humans|Lectins/metabolism|Oligosaccharides/metabolism|Polysaccharides/biosynthesis|Polysaccharides/chemistry|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism|Small Molecule Libraries,Escherichia coli/metabolism|Glycosyltransferases/isolation & purification|Glycosyltransferases/metabolism|Humans|Lectins/metabolism|Oligosaccharides/metabolism|Polysaccharides/biosynthesis|Polysaccharides/chemistry|Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism|Small Molecule Libraries,synthesi homogen glycan quantit yield repres major bottleneck product molecular tool glycosci glycan microarray affin resin refer standard describ combin biologicalenzymat synthesi capabl effici convert microbi deriv precursor oligosaccharid structur uniform human type n glycan unlik start materi obtain chemic synthesi direct isol natur sourc time consum costli gener approach involv precursor deriv renew sourc wild type saccharomyc cerevisia glycoprotein lipid link oligosaccharid glycoengin escherichia coli follow deglycosyl biosynthet precursor microbi oligosaccharid subject greatli simplifi purif scheme follow structur remodel commerci avail recombinantli produc glycosyltransferas key n acetylglucosaminyltransferas e.g gnti gntii gntiv involv earli remodel glycan mammalian glycosyl pathway approach prepar quantiti hybrid complex type n glycan asymmetr multi antennari structur gener subsequ glycan microarray high throughput fluoresc base screen glycan bind taken togeth confirm combin synthesi strategi new user friendli rout suppli chemic defin human glycan simpli combin biosynthet deriv precursor enzymat remodeling.,Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism

To identify new molecular processes associated with tumor metabolism, we analyzed the transcriptome of bulk and flow-sorted human primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) together with <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET scans, which provide a clinical measure of glucose uptake. Tumors with higher glucose uptake were functionally enriched for molecular processes associated with invasion in adenocarcinoma and cell growth in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Next, we identified genes correlated to glucose uptake that were predominately overexpressed in a single cell-type comprising the tumor microenvironment. For SCC, most of these genes were expressed by malignant cells, whereas in adenocarcinoma, they were predominately expressed by stromal cells, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Among these adenocarcinoma genes correlated to glucose uptake, we focused on glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (<i>GFPT2</i>), which codes for the glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 2 (GFAT2), a rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), which is responsible for glycosylation. <i>GFPT2</i> was predictive of glucose uptake independent of GLUT1, the primary glucose transporter, and was prognostically significant at both gene and protein level. We confirmed that normal fibroblasts transformed to CAF-like cells, following TGFβ treatment, upregulated HBP genes, including <i>GFPT2</i>, with less change in genes driving glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and TCA cycle. Our work provides new evidence of histology-specific tumor stromal properties associated with glucose uptake in NSCLC and identifies <i>GFPT2</i> as a critical regulator of tumor metabolic reprogramming in adenocarcinoma.<b>Significance:</b> These findings implicate the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway as a potential new therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma. <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3445-57. ©2018 AACR</i>.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adenocarcinoma of Lung/diagnostic imaging|Adenocarcinoma of Lung/mortality|Adenocarcinoma of Lung/pathology|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/metabolism|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnostic imaging|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Female|Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/administration & dosage|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Profiling|Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism|Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase (Isomerizing)/metabolism|Glycolysis|Glycosylation|Hexosamines/biosynthesis|Humans|Lung Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging|Lung Neoplasms/mortality|Lung Neoplasms/pathology|Male|Middle Aged|Neoplasm Invasiveness/diagnostic imaging|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Positron-Emission Tomography|Prognosis|Survival Analysis|Tumor Microenvironment","Adenocarcinoma of Lung/diagnostic imaging|Adenocarcinoma of Lung/mortality|Adenocarcinoma of Lung/pathology|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/metabolism|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnostic imaging|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Female|Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/administration & dosage|Follow-Up Studies|Gene Expression Profiling|Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism|Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase (Isomerizing)/metabolism|Glycolysis|Glycosylation|Hexosamines/biosynthesis|Humans|Lung Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging|Lung Neoplasms/mortality|Lung Neoplasms/pathology|Male|Middle Aged|Neoplasm Invasiveness/diagnostic imaging|Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology|Positron-Emission Tomography|Prognosis|Survival Analysis|Tumor Microenvironment",metabol reprogram microenviron recogn hallmark new molecular process metabol analyz transcriptom bulk flow sort human primari non small lung nsclc togeth 18 fdg pet scan provid clinic measur glucos uptak higher glucos uptak function enrich molecular process invas adenocarcinoma growth squamou carcinoma scc next correl glucos uptak predomin overexpress singl type compris microenviron scc malign wherea adenocarcinoma predomin stromal particularli fibroblast caf among adenocarcinoma correl glucos uptak focus glutamin fructos phosphat transaminas gfpt2 code glutamin fructos phosphat aminotransferas (gfat2 rate limit enzym hexosamin biosynthesi pathway hbp respons glycosyl gfpt2 predict glucos uptak independ glut1 primari glucos transport prognost confirm normal fibroblast transform caf like follow tgfβ treatment upregul hbp gfpt2 less chang drive glycolysi pentos phosphat pathway tca cycl work provid new evid histolog specif stromal properti glucos uptak nsclc gfpt2 critic regul metabol reprogram adenocarcinoma find implic hexosamin biosynthesi pathway new therapeut target lung adenocarcinoma 78 3445 aacr,Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology

Conventional chemotherapeutics are generally able to shrink the tumor mass, but often fail to completely eradicate cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) that are responsible for high risk of relapse and frequent metastases. In this study, we examined thermal sensibility of CSCs, developed an approach that enabled concurrent elimination of both the bulk of cancer cells and CSCs, and investigated the underlying mechanism.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We designed a platform consisting of gold nanoparticle-coated porous silicon microparticle (AuPSM) that was also loaded with docetaxel micelles (mDTXs) to enable concurrent killing of the bulk of cancer cells by released mDTX and CSCs by mild hyperthermia upon stimulation of AuPSM with near infrared. In addition, we examined the role of heat shock proteins in sensitizing CSC killing. Finally, we applied mDTX-loaded AuPSM to treat mice with SUM159 and 4T1 orthotopic tumors and evaluated tumor growth and tumor metastasis.<b>Results:</b> MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells treated with mDTX-loaded AuPSM and mild hyperthermia displayed significantly reduced efficiencies in mammosphere formation than those treated with mDTX alone or mild hyperthermia alone. Combination treatment also completely inhibited SUM159 orthotopic tumor growth and 4T1 tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, DTX treatment suppressed expression of heat shock protein 27 in cancer cells including the CSCs, rendering cells sensitive to mild hyperthermia.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our results indicate that chemotherapy sensitizes CSC to mild hyperthermia.

Yet, the chief orchestrators of these complex and intriguing shapes are a specialized class of membrane associating often peripheral proteins called curvature remodeling proteins (CRPs) that operate at the molecular level through specific protein-lipid interactions. We review multiscale methodologies to model these systems at the molecular as well as at the mesoscopic and cellular scales, and also present a free energy perspective of membrane remodeling through the organization and assembly of CRPs. We discuss the morphological space of nearly planar to highly curved membranes, methods to include thermal fluctuations, and review studies that model such proteins as curvature fields to describe the emergent curved morphologies. We also discuss several mesoscale models applied to a variety of cellular processes, where the phenomenological parameters (such as curvature field strength) are often mapped to models of real systems based on molecular simulations. Much insight can be gained from the calculation of free energies of membranes states with protein fields, which enable accurate mapping of the state and parameter values at which the membrane undergoes morphological transformations such as vesiculation or tubulation. By tuning the strength, anisotropy, and spatial organization of the curvature-field, one can generate a rich array of membrane morphologies that are highly relevant to shapes of several cellular organelles. We review applications of these models to budding of vesicles commonly seen in cellular signaling and trafficking processes such as clathrin mediated endocytosis, sorting by the ESCRT protein complexes, and cellular exocytosis regulated by the exocyst complex.

This question is especially important when using potent, targeted agents that have a poor penetration across an intact BBB. Efficacy of the murine double minute-2 (MDM2) inhibitor SAR405838 was tested in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of GBM. <i>In vitro</i> efficacy of SAR405838 was evaluated in PDX models with varying MDM2 expression and those with high (GBM108) and low (GBM102) expression were evaluated for flank and orthotopic efficacy. BBB permeability, evaluated using TexasRed-3 kDa dextran, was significantly increased in GBM108 through VEGFA overexpression. Drug delivery, MRI, and orthotopic survival were compared between BBB-intact (GBM108-vector) and BBB-disrupted (GBM108-VEGFA) models. MDM2-amplified PDX lines with high MDM2 expression were sensitive to SAR405838 in comparison with MDM2 control lines in both <i>in vitro</i> and heterotopic models. In contrast with profound efficacy observed in flank xenografts, SAR405838 was ineffective in orthotopic tumors. Although both GBM108-vector and GBM108-VEGFA readily imaged on MRI following gadolinium contrast administration, GBM108-VEGFA tumors had a significantly enhanced drug and gadolinium accumulation, as determined by MALDI-MSI. Enhanced drug delivery in GBM108-VEGFA translated into a marked improvement in orthotopic efficacy. This study clearly shows that limited drug distribution across a partially intact BBB may limit the efficacy of targeted agents in GBM.

We show that, in lieu of individual-level information, population-level data on cancer incidence and etiologic agent prevalence can be leveraged to investigate cancer mechanisms and to better characterize and predict cancer trends. We use mechanistic carcinogenesis models [multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) models] and data on smoking, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), and HPV infection prevalence to investigate trends of lung, gastric, and HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers. MSCE models are based on the initiation-promotion-malignant conversion paradigm and allow for interpretation of trends in terms of general biological mechanisms. We assumed the rates of initiation depend on the prevalence of the corresponding risk factors. We performed two types of analysis, using the agent prevalence and cancer incidence data to estimate the model parameters and using cancer incidence data to infer the etiologic agent prevalence as well as the model parameters. By including risk factor prevalence, MSCE models with as few as three parameters closely reproduced 40 years of age-specific cancer incidence data. We recovered trends of <i>H. pylori</i> prevalence in the United States and demonstrated that cohort effects can explain the observed bimodal, age-specific pattern of oral HPV prevalence in men. Our results demonstrate the potential for joint analyses of population-level cancer and risk factor data through mechanistic modeling. This approach can be a first step in systematically testing relationships between exposures and cancer risk when individual-level data is lacking.<b>Significance:</b> Analysis of trends in risk-factor prevalence and cancer incidence can shed light on cancer mechanisms and the way that carcinogen exposure through time shapes the risk of cancer at different ages.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/12/3386/F1.large.jpg <i>Cancer Res; 78(12); 3386-96. ©2018 AACR</i>.",U01,,,"Gastrointestinal tract, NOS",Stomach Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adult|Age Factors|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Carcinogenesis|Female|Helicobacter Infections/complications|Helicobacter Infections/epidemiology|Humans|Incidence|Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology|Lung Neoplasms/etiology|Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control|Male|Middle Aged|Models, Biological|Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology|Mouth Neoplasms/etiology|Mouth Neoplasms/prevention & control|Papillomavirus Infections/complications|Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology|Prevalence|Risk Factors|SEER Program/statistics & numerical data|Smoking/adverse effects|Smoking/epidemiology|Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology|Stomach Neoplasms/etiology|Stomach Neoplasms/prevention & control|United States","Adult|Age Factors|Aged|Aged, 80 and over|Carcinogenesis|Female|Helicobacter Infections/complications|Helicobacter Infections/epidemiology|Humans|Incidence|Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology|Lung Neoplasms/etiology|Lung Neoplasms/prevention & control|Male|Middle Aged|Models, Biological|Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology|Mouth Neoplasms/etiology|Mouth Neoplasms/prevention & control|Papillomavirus Infections/complications|Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology|Prevalence|Risk Factors|SEER Program/statistics & numerical data|Smoking/adverse effects|Smoking/epidemiology|Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology|Stomach Neoplasms/etiology|Stomach Neoplasms/prevention & control|United States",obtain detail individu exposur outcom challeng difficult understand character tempor aspect exposur translat risk lieu individu inform popul incid etiolog agent preval leverag investig mechan better character predict trend mechanist carcinogenesi model multistag clonal expans msce model smoke helicobact pylori h pylori hpv infect preval investig trend lung gastric hpv relat oropharyng msce model base initi promot malign convers paradigm allow interpret trend term gener biolog mechan assum rate initi depend preval correspond risk factor type agent preval incid estim model paramet incid infer etiolog agent preval well model paramet risk factor preval msce model three paramet close reproduc year age specif incid recov trend h pylori preval unit state cohort explain bimod age specif pattern oral hpv preval men joint analys popul risk factor mechanist model approach first step systemat test relationship exposur risk individu lack trend risk factor preval incid shed light mechan way carcinogen exposur time shape risk differ age graphic abstract http cancerres.aacrjournals.orgcontentcanr 12 f1.large.jpg 78 3386 aacr,CSBC U01 Project University of Michigan

However, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has resulted in variable clinical responses, raising the possibility of an inherent mechanism of resistance to treatment. As p110α mediates virtually all cellular responses to insulin, targeted inhibition of this enzyme disrupts glucose metabolism in multiple tissues. For example, blocking insulin signalling promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver and prevents glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in transient hyperglycaemia within a few hours of PI3K inhibition. The effect is usually transient because compensatory insulin release from the pancreas (insulin feedback) restores normal glucose homeostasis<sup>3</sup>. However, the hyperglycaemia may be exacerbated or prolonged in patients with any degree of insulin resistance and, in these cases, necessitates discontinuation of therapy<sup>3-6</sup>. We hypothesized that insulin feedback induced by PI3K inhibitors may reactivate the PI3K-mTOR signalling axis in tumours, thereby compromising treatment effectiveness<sup>7,8</sup>. Here we show, in several model tumours in mice, that systemic glucose-insulin feedback caused by targeted inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to activate PI3K signalling, even in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. This insulin feedback can be prevented using dietary or pharmaceutical approaches, which greatly enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratios of PI3K inhibitors.

However, the identification of kinase-substrate pairs remains an active area of research because the relationships between individual kinases and these phosphorylation sites remain largely unknown. Many techniques have been established to discover kinase substrates but are often technically challenging to perform. Moreover, these methods frequently rely on substrate reagent pools that do not reflect human protein sequences or are biased by human cell line protein expression profiles. Here, we describe a new approach called SERIOHL-KILR (serine-oriented human library-kinase library reactions) to profile kinase substrate specificity and to identify candidate substrates for serine kinases. Using a purified library of >100000 serine-oriented human peptides expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, we perform in vitro kinase reactions to identify phosphorylated human peptide sequences by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We compare our results for protein kinase A to those of a well-established positional scanning peptide library method, certifying that SERIOHL-KILR can identify the same predominant motif elements as traditional techniques. We then interrogate a small panel of cancer-associated PKCβ mutants using our profiling protocol and observe a shift in substrate specificity likely attributable to the loss of key polar contacts between the kinase and its substrates. Overall, we demonstrate that SERIOHL-KILR can rapidly identify candidate kinase substrates that can be directly mapped to human sequences for pathway analysis.

Some models consist solely of DCIS cells, either cell lines or primary cells. Others are co-cultures that include additional cell types present in the normal or cancerous human breast. The 3D co-culture models more accurately mimic structural and functional changes in breast architecture that accompany the transition of DCIS to IDC. Mechanistic studies of the dynamic and temporal changes associated with this transition are facilitated by adapting the in vitro models to engineered microfluidic platforms. Ultimately, the goal is to create in vitro models that can serve as a reproducible preclinical screen for testing therapeutic strategies that will reduce progression of DCIS to IDC.

We then used hierarchical clustering to generate inflammation signatures by combining the effects of identified cytokines and chemokines and summarized the signatures using an inflammation score. The analyses revealed six distinct signatures of sixteen cytokines/chemokines (P = 0.05) that differed significantly by prevalence of T2D (P = 0.004), obesity (P = 0.0231) and overall inflammation score (P < E-12). Signatures were validated in two independent cohorts of African American women with obesity: thirty nine subjects with no metabolic complications or with T2D and hypertension; and thirteen breast reduction surgical patients. The signatures in the validation cohorts closely resembled the distributions in the discovery cohort. We find that blood-based cytokine profiles usefully associate inflammation with T2D risks in vulnerable subjects, and should be combined with metabolism and obesity counselling for personalized risk assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"African Americans/statistics & numerical data|Biomarkers|Chemokines/blood|Cytokines/blood|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/ethnology|Female|Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis|Humans|Hypertension/blood|Hypertension/ethnology|Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use|Inflammation/blood|Inflammation/ethnology|Mammaplasty|Metabolic Syndrome/blood|Metabolic Syndrome/ethnology|Metformin/therapeutic use|Middle Aged|Obesity/blood|Obesity/ethnology|Prevalence|Severity of Illness Index|Thinness/blood|Thinness/ethnology|Waist-Hip Ratio","African Americans/statistics & numerical data|Biomarkers|Chemokines/blood|Cytokines/blood|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/ethnology|Female|Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis|Humans|Hypertension/blood|Hypertension/ethnology|Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use|Inflammation/blood|Inflammation/ethnology|Mammaplasty|Metabolic Syndrome/blood|Metabolic Syndrome/ethnology|Metformin/therapeutic use|Middle Aged|Obesity/blood|Obesity/ethnology|Prevalence|Severity of Illness Index|Thinness/blood|Thinness/ethnology|Waist-Hip Ratio",obes driven type diabet t2d system inflammatori condit cardiovascular diseas plasma cytokin tissu inflamm discrimin t2d risk african american women obes phenotyp well understood analyz circul cytokin chemokin plasma african american women enrol black women health regress cytokin chemokin obes co morbid t2d hypertens obes women without co morbid well lean women without co morbid hierarch cluster gener inflamm signatur combin cytokin chemokin summar signatur inflamm score analys reveal six distinct signatur sixteen cytokineschemokin p differ significantli preval t2d p obes p overal inflamm score p e signatur valid independ cohort african american women obes thirti nine subject metabol complic t2d hypertens thirteen breast reduct surgic patient signatur valid cohort close resembl distribut discoveri cohort find blood base cytokin profil inflamm t2d risk vulner subject combin metabol obes counsel person risk assessment.,

During the gene editing processes, these RNA-guide nucleases introduce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), in which non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) dominates the DNA repair pathway, limiting the efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR), the alternative pathway essential for precise gene targeting. Multiple approaches have been developed to enhance HDR, including chemical compound or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of NHEJ factors, small molecule activation of HDR enzymes, or cell cycle timed delivery of CRISPR complex. However, these approaches face multiple challenges, yet have moderate or variable effects. Here we developed a new approach that programs both NHEJ and HDR pathways with CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) to achieve significantly enhanced HDR efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene editing. The manipulation of NHEJ and HDR pathway components, such as CtIP, CDK1, KU70, KU80, and LIG4, was mediated by catalytically dead guide RNAs (dgRNAs), thus relying on only a single catalytically active Cas9 to perform both CRISPRa/i and precise gene editing. While reprogramming of most DNA repair factors or their combinations tested enhanced HDR efficiency, simultaneously activating <i>CDK1</i> and repressing <i>KU80</i> has the strongest effect with increased HDR rate upto an order of magnitude. Doxycycline-induced dgRNA-based CRISPRa/i programming of DNA repair enzymes, as well as viral packaging enabled flexible and tunable HDR enhancement for broader applicability in mammalian cells. Our study provides an effective, flexible, and potentially safer strategy to enhance precise genome modifications, which might broadly impact human gene editing and therapy.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,crispr system proven versatil tool site specif genom engin mammalian speci edit process rna guid nucleas introduc dna doubl strand break dsb non homolog dna end join nhej domin dna repair pathway limit effici homolog direct repair hdr altern pathway essenti precis target multipl approach enhanc hdr chemic compound rna interfer mediat inhibit nhej factor small molecul hdr enzym cycl time deliveri crispr complex approach face multipl challeng yet moder variabl new approach program nhej hdr pathway crispr interfer crisprai achiev significantli enhanc hdr effici crispr mediat edit manipul nhej hdr pathway compon ctip cdk1 ku70 ku80 lig4 mediat catalyt dead guid rna dgrna thu reli singl catalyt cas9 crisprai precis edit reprogram dna repair factor combin test enhanc hdr effici simultan cdk1 repress ku80 strongest hdr rate upto order magnitud doxycyclin induc dgrna base crisprai program dna repair enzym well viral packag enabl flexibl tunabl hdr enhanc broader applic mammalian provid flexibl safer strategi enhanc precis genom modif might broadli impact human edit therapy.,Systems Analysis of Phenotypic Switch in Control of Cancer Invasion

MMSET overexpression in MM leads to an increase in histone 3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2), and a decrease in histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), as well as changes in proliferation, gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Prior work linked methylation of histones to the ability of cells to undergo DNA damage repair. In addition, t(4;14)+ patients frequently relapse after regimens that include DNA damage-inducing agents, suggesting that MMSET may play a role in DNA damage repair and response. In U2OS cells, we found that MMSET is required for efficient non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination. Loss of MMSET led to loss of expression of several DNA repair proteins, as well as decreased recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). By using genetically matched MM cell lines that had either high (pathological) or low (physiological) expression of MMSET, we found that MMSET-high cells had increased damage at baseline. Upon addition of a DNA-damaging agent, MMSET-high cells repaired DNA damage at an enhanced rate and continued to proliferate, whereas MMSET-low cells accumulated DNA damage and entered cell cycle arrest. In a murine xenograft model using t(4;14)+ KMS11 MM cells harboring an inducible MMSET shRNA, depletion of MMSET enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy, inhibiting tumor growth and extending survival.

As a cell migrates through its extracellular matrix (ECM), lamellipod growth increases cell-ECM contact area and enhances engagement of integrin receptors, locally amplifying ECM input to internal signaling cascades. In contrast, contraction of lamellipodia results in reduced integrin engagement that dampens the level of ECM-induced signaling. These changes in cell shape are both influenced by, and feed back onto ECM signaling. Motivated by experimental observations on melanoma cells lines (1205Lu and SBcl2) migrating on fibronectin (FN) coated topographic substrates (anisotropic post-density arrays), we probe this interplay between intracellular and ECM signaling. Experimentally, cells exhibited one of three lamellipodial dynamics: persistently polarized, random, or oscillatory, with competing lamellipodia oscillating out of phase (Park et al., 2017). Pharmacological treatments, changes in FN density, and substrate topography all affected the fraction of cells exhibiting these behaviours. We use these observations as constraints to test a sequence of hypotheses for how intracellular (GTPase) and ECM signaling jointly regulate lamellipodial dynamics. The models encoding these hypotheses are predicated on mutually antagonistic Rac-Rho signaling, Rac-mediated protrusion (via activation of Arp2/3 actin nucleation) and Rho-mediated contraction (via ROCK phosphorylation of myosin light chain), which are coupled to ECM signaling that is modulated by protrusion/contraction.

Of the 11 genes recurrently mutated in HNSCC, we identify a singular and substantial survival advantage for mutations in the gene encoding Nuclear Set Domain Containing Protein 1 (<i>NSD1</i>), a histone methyltransferase altered in approximately 10% of patients. This effect, a 55% decrease in risk of death in <i>NSD1</i>-mutated versus non-mutated patients, can be validated in an independent cohort. <i>NSD1</i> alterations are strongly associated with widespread genome hypomethylation in the same tumors, to a degree not observed for any other mutated gene. To address whether <i>NSD1</i> plays a causal role in these associations, we use CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt <i>NSD1</i> in HNSCC cell lines and find that this leads to substantial CpG hypomethylation and sensitivity to cisplatin, a standard chemotherapy in head and neck cancer, with a 40% to 50% decrease in the IC<sub>50</sub> value.

Glial cell-derived tumors and the cells derived from them are highly heterogeneous and variable in their mechanical properties, their response to treatments, and their properties in vitro. Some glioma samples are stiffer than normal brain when measured ex vivo, but even those that are soft in vitro stiffen after deformation by pressure gradients that arise in the tumor environment in vivo. Such mechanical differences can strongly alter the phenotype of cultured glioma cells. Alternatively, chemical signaling might elicit the same phenotype as increased stiffness by activating intracellular messengers common to both initial stimuli. In this study the responses of three different human glioma cell lines to changes in substrate stiffness are compared with their responses on very soft substrates composed of a combination of hyaluronic acid and a specific integrin ligand, either laminin or collagen I. By quantifying cell morphology, stiffness, motility, proliferation, and secretion of the cytokine IL-8, glioma cell responses to increased stiffness are shown to be nearly identically elicited by substrates containing hyaluronic acid, even in the absence of increased stiffness. PI3-kinase activity was required for the response to hyaluronan but not to stiffness. This outcome suggests that hyaluronic acid can trigger the same cellular response, as can be obtained by mechanical force transduced from a stiff environment, and demonstrates that chemical and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment can achieve equivalent reactions in cancer cells.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Cell Proliferation|Elasticity|Glioma/metabolism|Humans|Hyaluronic Acid/chemistry|Hyaluronic Acid/pharmacology|Interleukin-8/metabolism|Neuroglia/cytology|Neuroglia/drug effects|Neuroglia/metabolism|Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism|Surface Properties|Tissue Scaffolds/adverse effects|Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry","Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Movement|Cell Proliferation|Elasticity|Glioma/metabolism|Humans|Hyaluronic Acid/chemistry|Hyaluronic Acid/pharmacology|Interleukin-8/metabolism|Neuroglia/cytology|Neuroglia/drug effects|Neuroglia/metabolism|Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism|Surface Properties|Tissue Scaffolds/adverse effects|Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry",unlik mani grow character abnorm stiff collagen enrich stroma glioma prolifer migrat much softer environ brain gener lack filament matrix characterist breast liver colorect type glial deriv deriv highli heterogen variabl mechan properti respons treatment properti vitro glioma sampl stiffer normal brain measur ex vivo even soft vitro stiffen deform pressur gradient aris environ vivo mechan differ strongli alter phenotyp cultur glioma altern chemic signal might elicit phenotyp stiff intracellular messeng common initi stimuli respons three differ human glioma line chang substrat stiff respons soft substrat compos combin hyaluron acid specif integrin ligand either laminin collagen quantifi morpholog stiff motil prolifer secret cytokin il glioma respons stiff nearli ident elicit substrat contain hyaluron acid even absenc stiff pi3 kinas requir respons hyaluronan stiff outcom hyaluron acid trigger cellular respons obtain mechan forc transduc stiff environ chemic mechan featur microenviron achiev equival reaction cells.,Physical Science Oncology Center at Penn

SdRNAs have been implicated in human cancer; however, a systems-level sdRNA landscape in human cancers is lacking. Through integrative analysis of ~22 nt size-selected smRNA-seq datasets from 10,262 patient samples across 32 cancer types, we mapped a pan-cancer sdRNAome and interrogated its signatures in multiple clinically relevant features, particularly cancer immunity and clinical outcome. Aggregating sdRNA abundances by parental snoRNAs, these expression signatures alone are sufficient to distinguish patients with distinct cancer types. Interestingly, a large panel of sdRNAs are significantly correlated with features of the tumor-immune microenvironment, such as immunosuppressive markers, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, cytolytic T cell activity, and tumor vasculature.

The observability problem concerns reconstructing the network state from this limited information. Here, we propose a general optimization-based approach for observing the states of nonlinear networks and for optimally selecting the observed variables. Our results reveal several fundamental limitations in network observability, such as the trade-off between the fraction of observed variables and the observation length on one side, and the estimation error on the other side. We also show that, owing to the crucial role played by the dynamics, purely graph-theoretic observability approaches cannot provide conclusions about one's practical ability to estimate the states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by finding the key components in biological and combustion reaction networks from which we determine the full system state.

GDF11 promotes an epithelial, anti-invasive phenotype in 3D triple-negative cultures and intraductal xenografts by sustaining expression of E-cadherin and inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2). Surprisingly, clinical TNBCs retain the GDF11 locus and expression of the protein itself. GDF11 bioactivity is instead lost because of deficiencies in its convertase, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), causing inactive GDF11 precursor to accumulate intracellularly.

Although pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has historically been refractory to kinase inhibition, therapeutic activation of phosphatases is emerging as a promising strategy to restore balance to these hyperactive signaling cascades. In this study, we hypothesized that phosphatase activation combined with kinase inhibition could deplete oncogenic survival signals to reduce tumor growth. We screened PDA cell lines for kinase inhibitors that could synergize with activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a tumor suppressor phosphatase, and determined that activation of PP2A and inhibition of mTOR synergistically increase apoptosis and reduce oncogenic phenotypes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This combination treatment resulted in suppression of AKT/mTOR signaling coupled with reduced expression of c-MYC, an oncoprotein implicated in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Forced expression of c-MYC or loss of PP2A B56α, the specific PP2A subunit shown to negatively regulate c-MYC, increased resistance to mTOR inhibition. Conversely, decreased c-MYC expression increased the sensitivity of PDA cells to mTOR inhibition. Together, these studies demonstrate that combined targeting of PP2A and mTOR suppresses proliferative signaling and induces cell death and implicates this combination as a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with PDA. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings present a combinatorial strategy targeting serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A and mTOR in PDA, a cancer for which there are currently no targeted therapeutic options.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/1/209/F1.large.jpg.",U54,,,Pancreatic duct,Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kinas often phosphatas suppress lead aberr signal pathway drive cellular prolifer surviv therapeut resist although pancreat ductal adenocarcinoma pda histor refractori kinas inhibit therapeut phosphatas emerg promis strategi restor balanc hyperact signal cascad hypothes phosphatas combin kinas inhibit could deplet oncogen surviv signal reduc growth screen pda line kinas inhibitor could synerg phosphatas 2a pp2a suppressor phosphatas pp2a inhibit mtor synergist apoptosi reduc oncogen phenotyp vitro vivo combin treatment suppress aktmtor signal coupl reduc c myc oncoprotein implic progress therapeut resist forc c myc loss pp2a b56α specif pp2a subunit neg regul c myc resist mtor inhibit convers decreas c myc sensit pda mtor inhibit togeth combin target pp2a mtor suppress prolif signal induc death implic combin promis therapeut strategi patient pda find present combinatori strategi target serinethreonin phosphatas pp2a mtor pda current target therapeut option graphic abstract http cancerres.aacrjournals.orgcontentcanr 1 f1.large.jpg.,"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity (M2CH)"

This problem can be addressed by creating stringent tumor-specific networks of biophysical protein interactions, identified by signatures of epistatic selection during tumor evolution. Using such an evolutionarily selected pathway (ESP) map, we analyze the major cancer genome atlases to derive a hierarchical classification of tumor subtypes linked to characteristic mutated pathways.

Mislocalization is greatly enhanced by lamin A depletion, requires hours for nuclear reentry, and correlates with an increase in pan-nucleoplasmic foci of the DNA damage marker γH2AX. Excess DNA damage is rescued in ruptured nuclei by cooverexpression of multiple DNA repair factors as well as by soft matrix or inhibition of actomyosin tension. Increased contractility has the opposite effect, and stiff tumors with low lamin A indeed exhibit increased nuclear curvature, more frequent nuclear rupture, and excess DNA damage.

That relationship is shown to govern processes as diverse as maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from non-asthmatic or asthmatic donors, and formation of the ventral furrow in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Across these and other epithelial systems, shape variability collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for by a mechanistic theory of cell-cell interaction showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings suggest a connection between jamming and geometry that spans living organisms and inert jammed systems, and thus transcends system details.

Subsequently, a large panel of breast cancer cell lines was used to validate that hypoxia induces the expression of integrins that bind to collagen (ITGA1, ITGA11, ITGB1) and fibronectin (ITGA5, ITGB1).

This Thr zipper structure suggests that the protein interface is stabilized by close-packing of the Thr residues, with only one intermonomer hydrogen bond (H-bond) between two of the Thr residues. This Thr-rich interface provides a unique opportunity to study the behavior of Thr in the context of many other Thr residues. In previous work, we have shown that the side chain (χ<sub>1</sub> ) dihedral angles of interface and core Thr residues can be predicted with high accuracy using a hard sphere plus stereochemical constraint (HS) model. Here, we demonstrate that in the Thr-rich local environment of the Thr zipper structure, we are able to predict the χ<sub>1</sub> dihedral angles of most of the Thr residues. Some, however, are not well predicted by the HS model. We therefore employed explicitly solvated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to further investigate the side chain conformations of these residues. The MD simulations illustrate the role that transient H-bonding to water, in combination with steric constraints, plays in determining the behavior of these Thr side chains. Broader Audience Statement: Protein-protein interactions are critical to life and the search for ways to disrupt adverse protein-protein interactions involved in disease is an ongoing area of drug discovery. We must better understand protein-protein interfaces, both to be able to disrupt existing ones and to engineer new ones for a variety of biotechnological applications.

However, there is growing evidence that certain cell surface molecules are driven by the fluctuating dynamics of cortical cytoskeleton. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measure the diffusion coefficient of a variety of cell surface molecules over a temperature range of 24-37 °C. Exogenously incorporated fluorescent lipids with short acyl chains exhibit the expected increase of diffusion coefficient over this temperature range. In contrast, we find that GPI-anchored proteins exhibit temperature-independent diffusion over this range and revert to temperature-dependent diffusion on cell membrane blebs, in cells depleted of cholesterol, and upon acute perturbation of actin dynamics and myosin activity. A model transmembrane protein with a cytosolic actin-binding domain also exhibits the temperature-independent behavior, directly implicating the role of cortical actin. We show that diffusion of GPI-anchored proteins also becomes temperature dependent when the filamentous dynamic actin nucleator formin is inhibited. However, changes in cortical actin mesh size or perturbation of branched actin nucleator Arp2/3 do not affect this behavior.

While traditional views in cancer have held that cellular and tumor phenotypes are largely functions of genomic instability, increasing attention has recently been given to epigenetic and microenvironmental influences. Such non-genetic factors allow cancer cells to experience intrinsic diversity and plasticity, and at the tumor level can result in phenotypic heterogeneity and treatment evasion. In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka exploited the epigenome's plasticity by ""reprogramming"" differentiated cells into a pluripotent state by inducing expression of a cocktail of four transcription factors. Recent advances in cancer biology have shown not only that cellular reprogramming is possible for malignant cells, but it may provide a foundation for future therapies. Nevertheless, cell reprogramming experiments are frequently plagued by low efficiency, activation of aberrant transcriptional programs, instability, and often rely on expertise gathered from systems which may not translate directly to cancer.

Bone metastases cause substantial morbidity, including life-threatening spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia. Given the high prevalence of patients with breast cancer, health-care costs of bone metastases (>$20,000 per episode) impose a tremendous economic burden on society. To investigate mechanisms of bone metastasis, we developed femoral artery injection of cancer cells as a physiologically relevant model of bone metastasis. Comparing young (~6 weeks), skeletally immature mice to old (~6 months) female mice with closed physes (growth plates), we showed significantly greater progression of osteolytic metastases in young animals. Bone destruction increased in the old mice following ovariectomy, emphasizing the pathologic consequences of greater bone turnover and net loss. Despite uniform initial distribution of breast cancer cells throughout the hind limb after femoral artery injection, we observed preferential formation of osteolytic bone metastases in the proximal tibia. Tropism for the proximal tibia arises in part because of TGF-<i>β</i>, a cytokine abundant in both physes of skeletally immature mice and matrix of bone in mice of all ages. We also showed that age-dependent effects on osteolytic bone metastases did not occur in male mice with disseminated breast cancer cells in bone.

Macrophages enhance invasion and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment, but the basis for their effects is not fully understood. Using a microfluidic 3D cell migration assay, we found that the presence of macrophages enhanced the speed and persistence of cancer cell migration through a 3D extracellular matrix in a matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-dependent fashion. Mechanistic investigations revealed that macrophage-released TNFα and TGFβ1 mediated the observed behaviors by two distinct pathways. These factors synergistically enhanced migration persistence through a synergistic induction of NF-κB-dependent MMP1 expression in cancer cells. In contrast, macrophage-released TGFβ1 enhanced migration speed primarily by inducing MT1-MMP expression. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into how macrophages enhance cancer cell metastasis, and they identify TNFα and TGFβ1 dual blockade as an antimetastatic strategy in solid tumors.

In this study, we engineered a three-dimensional microfluidic model of the human microvasculature to recapitulate the environment wherein extravasation takes place and assess the consequences of β1 depletion in cancer cells. Combined with confocal imaging, these tools allowed us to decipher the detailed morphology of transmigrating tumor cells and associated endothelial cells in vitro at high spatio-temporal resolution not easily achieved in conventional transmigration assays. Dynamic imaging revealed that β1-depleted cells lacked the ability to sustain protrusions into the subendothelial matrix in contrast with control cells. Specifically, adhesion via α3β1 and α6β1 to subendothelial laminin was a critical prerequisite for successful transmigration. β1 was required to invade past the endothelial basement membrane, whereas its attenuation in a syngeneic tumor model resulted in reduced metastatic colonization of the lung, an effect not observed upon depletion of other integrin alpha and beta subunits. Collectively, our findings in this novel model of the extravasation microenvironment revealed a critical requirement for β1 in several steps of extravasation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying metastasis.

Individual dwell times were long enough to discriminate pMHC half-lives and T cell receptor (TCR) accumulation selectively stabilized microvilli.

Cancer cells induce activation of normal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. A better understanding of these interactions could lead to new, targeted therapies for cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To overcome limitations of standard monolayer cell cultures and xenograft models that lack tumor complexity and/or human stroma, we have developed a high throughput tumor spheroid technology utilizing a polymeric aqueous two-phase system to conveniently model interactions of CAFs and TNBC cells and quantify effects on signaling and drug resistance of cancer cells. We focused on signaling by chemokine CXCL12, a hallmark molecule secreted by CAFs, and receptor CXCR4, a driver of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. Using three-dimensional stromal-TNBC cells cultures, we demonstrate that CXCL12 - CXCR4 signaling significantly increases growth of TNBC cells and drug resistance through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Despite resistance to standard chemotherapy, upregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling sensitizes TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids to specific inhibitors of these kinase pathways. Furthermore, disrupting CXCL12 - CXCR4 signaling diminishes drug resistance of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroid models.

Here, using suspended fibers, we report integrative and multiscale abilities to study protrusive behavior independent of cell body migration. By manipulating the diameter of fibers in orthogonal directions, we constrain cell migration along large diameter (2 μm) base fibers, while solely allowing cells to sense, initiate, and mature protrusions on orthogonally deposited high-curvature/low diameter (∼100, 200, and 600 nm) protrusive fibers and low-curvature (∼300 and 600 nm width) protrusive flat ribbons. In doing so, we report a set of morphodynamic metrics that precisely quantitate protrusion dynamics. Protrusion growth and maturation occur by rapid broadening at the base to achieve long lengths, a behavior dramatically influenced by curvature. While flat ribbons universally induce the formation of broad and long protrusions, we quantitatively protrutype protrusive behavior of two highly invasive cancer cell lines and find breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) to exhibit sensitivity to fiber curvature higher than that of brain glioblastoma DBTRG-05MG. Furthermore, while actin and microtubules localize within protrusions of all sizes, we quantify protrusion size-driven localization of vimentin and, contrary to current understanding, report that vimentin is not required to form protrusions. Using multiple protrusive fibers, we quantify high coordination between hierarchical branches of individual protrusions and describe how the spatial configuration of multiple protrusions regulates cell migratory state.

Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy have shown exciting therapeutic promise for metastatic patients. While most therapies target T cells, other immune cells, such as monocytes, hold great promise for therapeutic intervention. In our study, we provide primary evidence of direct engagement between human monocytes and tumor cells in a 3D vascularized microfluidic model. We first characterize the novel application of our model to investigate and visualize at high resolution the evolution of monocytes as they migrate from the intravascular to the extravascular micro-environment. We also demonstrate their differentiation into macrophages in our all-human model. Our model replicates physiological differences between different monocyte subsets. In particular, we report that inflammatory, but not patrolling, monocytes rely on actomyosin based motility. Finally, we exploit this platform to study the effect of monocytes, at different stages of their life cycle, on cancer cell extravasation. Our data demonstrates that monocytes can directly reduce cancer cell extravasation in a non-contact dependent manner. In contrast, we see little effect of monocytes on cancer cell extravasation once monocytes transmigrate through the vasculature and are macrophage-like. Taken together, our study brings novel insight into the role of monocytes in cancer cell extravasation, which is an important step in the metastatic cascade. These findings establish our microfluidic platform as a powerful tool to investigate the characteristics and function of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in normal and diseased states.

Here we review recent findings specifically in the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions that have revealed conserved mechanisms whereby extracellular force, mediated through cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell junctional complexes, induces transcriptional reprogramming to alter cell and tissue fate. We focus on the interplay between tissue mechanics and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions that occur during embryonic development and cancer malignancy.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Rap1Gap, a GTPase activating protein, in the progression from DCIS to IDC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of samples from breast cancer patients shows an increase in Rap1Gap expression in DCIS compared to normal breast tissue and IDCs. In order to study the mechanisms of malignant progression, we employed an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model that more accurately recapitulates both structural and functional cues of breast tissue. Immunoblotting results show that Rap1Gap levels in MCF10.Ca1D cells (a model of invasive carcinoma) are reduced compared to those in MCF10.DCIS (a model of DCIS). Retroviral silencing of Rap1Gap in MCF10.DCIS cells activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), induced extensive cytoskeletal reorganization and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype, and enhanced invasion. Enforced reexpression of Rap1Gap in MCF10.DCIS-Rap1GapshRNA cells reduced Rap1 activity and reversed the mesenchymal phenotype. Similarly, introduction of dominant negative Rap1A mutant (Rap1A-N17) in DCIS-Rap1Gap shRNA cells caused a reversion to nonmalignant phenotype. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Rap1A mutant (Rap1A-V12) in noninvasive MCF10.DCIS cells led to phenotypic changes that were reminiscent of Rap1Gap knockdown. Thus, reduction of Rap1Gap in DCIS is a potential switch for progression to an invasive phenotype.

However, the duration of tumor remission varies unpredictably among patients, and relapse is almost inevitable. Here, we examine the responses of several BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines (including isogenic subclones) to BRAF inhibitors. We observe complex response dynamics across cell lines, with short-term responses (<100 h) varying from cell line to cell line. In the long term, however, we observe equilibration of all drug-treated populations into a nonquiescent state characterized by a balanced rate of death and division, which we term the ""idling"" state, and to our knowledge, this state has not been previously reported. Using mathematical modeling, we propose that the observed population-level dynamics are the result of cells transitioning between basins of attraction within a drug-modified phenotypic landscape. Each basin is associated with a drug-induced proliferation rate, a recently introduced metric of an antiproliferative drug effect. The idling population state represents a new dynamic equilibrium in which cells are distributed across the landscape such that the population achieves zero net growth. By fitting our model to experimental drug-response data, we infer the phenotypic landscapes of all considered melanoma cell lines and provide a unifying view of how BRAF-mutated melanomas respond to BRAF inhibition. We hypothesize that the residual disease observed in patients after targeted therapy is composed of a significant number of idling cells.

While the role of associated signaling and structural events have been well studied, associated intercellular stresses under laminar fluid shear have remained ill-defined and the role of these stresses in the alignment process has remained obscure. To fill this gap, we report here the tractions as well as the complete in-plane intercellular stress fields measured within the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer subjected to a steady laminar fluid shear of 1 Pa. Tractions, intercellular stresses, as well as their time course, heterogeneity, and anisotropy, were measured using monolayer traction microscopy and monolayer stress microscopy. Prior to application of laminar fluid flow, intercellular stresses were largely tensile but fluctuated dramatically in space and in time (317 ± 122 Pa). Within 12 h of the onset of laminar fluid flow, the intercellular stresses decreased substantially but continued to fluctuate dramatically (142 ± 84 Pa). Moreover, tractions and intercellular stresses aligned strongly and promptly (within 1 h) along the direction of fluid flow, whereas the endothelial cell body aligned less strongly and substantially more slowly (12 h).

In several KRAS-driven mouse models, both the loss of TGF-β signaling and elevated β1-integrin mechanosignaling engaged a positive feedback loop whereby STAT3 signaling promotes tumor progression by increasing matricellular fibrosis and tissue tension.

To identify adhesion receptor systems and matrix structures supporting glioma cell invasion into brain-like environments we used 2D and 3D organotypic invasion assays in combination with antibody-, peptide- and RNA-based interference. Combined interference with β1 and αV integrins abolished the migration of U-251 and E-98 glioma cells on reconstituted basement membrane; however, invasion into primary brain slices or 3D astrocyte-based scaffolds and migration on astrocyte-deposited matrix was only partly inhibited. Any residual invasion was supported by vascular structures, as well as laminin 511, a central constituent of basement membrane of brain blood vessels. Multi-targeted interference against β1, αV and α6 integrins expressed by U-251 and E-98 cells proved insufficient to achieve complete migration arrest.

However, the positively charged TAT peptide strongly interacts with serum components and undergoes substantial phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, causing a short blood circulation in vivo. In this work, an acid-active tumor targeting nanoplatform DA-TAT-PECL is developed to inhibit the nonspecific interactions of TAT in the bloodstream. 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DA) is used to convert the TAT's amines to carboxylic acid; the resulting DA-TAT is conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL, PECL) to get DA-TAT-PECL. After self-assembly into polymeric micelles, they are capable of circulating in the physiological condition for a long time and promoting cell penetration upon accumulation at the tumor site and deshielding the DA group. Moreover, camptothecin (CPT) is used as the anticancer drug and modified into a dimer (CPT)<sub>2</sub> -ss-Mal, in which two CPT molecules are connected by a reduction-labile maleimide thioether bond.

Analysis of gene expression changes associated with the EMT program led to the identification of an EMT-induced cell-surface protein, podocalyxin (PODXL), as a key mediator of extravasation in mesenchymal breast and pancreatic carcinoma cells. PODXL promotes extravasation through direct interaction of its intracellular domain with the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin. Ezrin proceeds to establish dorsal cortical polarity, enabling the transition of cancer cells from a non-polarized, rounded cell morphology to an invasive extravasation-competent shape.

Through disruption of traction forces, we observe a profound phenotypic shift towards a mode of dendritic protrusion and identify bimodal processes that govern guidance sensing. In contractile cells, guidance sensing is strongly dependent on formins and FAK signaling and can be perturbed by disrupting microtubule dynamics, while low traction conditions initiate fluidic-like dendritic protrusions that are dependent on Arp2/3.

DNA repair factors invariably mislocalize after migration, and an excess of DNA damage is evident as pan--nucleoplasmic foci of phosphoactivated ATM and γH2AX. Foci counts are suppressed in late cell cycle as expected of mitotic checkpoints, and migration of contact-inhibited cells through large pores into sparse microenvironments leads also as expected to cell-cycle reentry and no effect on a basal level of damage foci. Constricting pores delay such reentry while excess foci occur independent of cell-cycle phase.

Physical and biochemical gradients that form within the primary tumor tissue promote tumor cell invasion and drive persistent migration toward blood vessels and the lymphatics to facilitate tumor cell dissemination. These microenvironment cues include hypoxia and pH gradients, gradients of soluble cues that induce chemotaxis, and ions that facilitate galvanotaxis, as well as modifications to the concentration, organization, and stiffness of the extracellular matrix that produce haptotactic, alignotactic, and durotactic gradients. These gradients form through dynamic interactions between the tumor cells and the resident fibroblasts, adipocytes, nerves, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. Malignant progression results from the integrated response of the tumor to these extrinsic physical and chemical cues.

The highly aggressive invasion of malignant cells into the normal brain parenchyma renders complete surgical resection of GBM tumors impossible, increases resistance to therapeutic treatment, and leads to near-universal tumor recurrence. We have previously demonstrated that TROY (TNFRSF19) plays an important role in glioblastoma cell invasion and therapeutic resistance. However, the potential downstream effectors of TROY signaling have not been fully characterized. Here, we identified PDZ-RhoGEF as a binding partner for TROY that potentiated TROY-induced nuclear factor kappa B activation which is necessary for both cell invasion and survival. In addition, PDZ-RhoGEF also interacts with Pyk2, indicating that PDZ-RhoGEF is a component of a signalsome that includes TROY and Pyk2. PDZ-RhoGEF is overexpressed in glioblastoma tumors and stimulates glioma cell invasion via Rho activation. Increased PDZ-RhoGEF expression enhanced TROY-induced glioma cell migration. Conversely, silencing PDZ-RhoGEF expression inhibited TROY-induced glioma cell migration, increased sensitivity to temozolomide treatment, and extended survival of orthotopic xenograft mice. Furthermore, depletion of RhoC or RhoA inhibited TROY- and PDZ-RhoGEF-induced cell migration. Mechanistically, increased TROY expression stimulated Rho activation, and depletion of PDZ-RhoGEF expression reduced this activation. Taken together, these data suggest that PDZ-RhoGEF plays an important role in TROY signaling and provides insights into a potential node of vulnerability to limit GBM cell invasion and decrease therapeutic resistance.",U01,,,"Brain, NOS",Glioblastoma Multiforme,Expression Array,,,,,,,metastasis,,,,,,"Animals|Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy|Brain Neoplasms/metabolism|Brain Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Survival|Female|Focal Adhesion Kinase 2/metabolism|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Glioblastoma/drug therapy|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Glioblastoma/pathology|Humans|Mice, Nude|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism|Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics|Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/metabolism|Signal Transduction|Temozolomide/pharmacology|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays|rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics|rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism|rhoC GTP-Binding Protein/genetics|rhoC GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism","Animals|Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy|Brain Neoplasms/metabolism|Brain Neoplasms/pathology|Cell Line, Tumor|Cell Survival|Female|Focal Adhesion Kinase 2/metabolism|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Glioblastoma/drug therapy|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Glioblastoma/pathology|Humans|Mice, Nude|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism|Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics|Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/metabolism|Signal Transduction|Temozolomide/pharmacology|Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays|rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics|rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism|rhoC GTP-Binding Protein/genetics|rhoC GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism",glioblastoma multiform gbm common type malign brain adult dismal prognosi highli aggress invas malign normal brain parenchyma render complet surgic resect gbm imposs resist therapeut treatment lead near univers recurr previous troy tnfrsf19 play import role glioblastoma invas therapeut resist downstream effector troy signal fulli character pdz rhogef bind partner troy troy induc nuclear factor kappa b necessari invas surviv addit pdz rhogef interact pyk2 indic pdz rhogef compon signalsom troy pyk2 pdz rhogef overexpress glioblastoma stimul glioma invas via rho pdz rhogef enhanc troy induc glioma migrat convers silenc pdz rhogef inhibit troy induc glioma migrat sensit temozolomid treatment extend surviv orthotop xenograft mice furthermor deplet rhoc rhoa inhibit troy pdz rhogef induc migrat mechanist troy stimul rho deplet pdz rhogef reduc taken togeth pdz rhogef play import role troy signal provid insight node vulner limit gbm invas decreas therapeut resistance.,Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma

During early T-cell receptor (TCR) activation, phosphorylation of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) leading to recruitment of adaptor proteins, including Grb2, is one prototypical example. LAT contains multiple modifiable sites, and this multivalency may provide additional layers of regulation, although this is not well understood. Here, we quantitatively analyze the effects of multivalent phosphorylation of LAT by reconstituting the initial reactions of the TCR signaling pathway on supported membranes. Results from a series of LAT constructs with combinatorial mutations of tyrosine residues reveal a previously unidentified allosteric mechanism in which the binding affinity of LAT:Grb2 depends on the phosphorylation at remote tyrosine sites. Additionally, we find that LAT:Grb2 binding affinity is altered by membrane localization. This allostery mainly regulates the kinetic on-rate, not off-rate, of LAT:Grb2 interactions. LAT is an intrinsically disordered protein, and these data suggest that phosphorylation changes the overall ensemble of configurations to modulate the accessibility of other phosphorylated sites to Grb2. Using Grb2 as a phosphorylation reporter, we further monitored LAT phosphorylation by TCR ζ chain-recruited ZAP-70, which suggests a weakly processive catalysis on membranes.

Although biomarker studies established the role of AR-V7 in resistance to AR-targeting therapies, how AR-V7 mediates genomic functions in CRPC remains largely unknown. Using a ChIP-exo approach, we show AR-V7 binds to distinct genomic regions and recognizes a full-length androgen-responsive element in CRPC cells and patient tissues. Remarkably, we find dramatic differences in AR-V7 cistromes across diverse CRPC cells and patient tissues, regulating different target gene sets involved in CRPC progression. Surprisingly, we discover that HoxB13 is universally required for and colocalizes with AR-V7 binding to open chromatin across CRPC genomes. HoxB13 pioneers AR-V7 binding through direct physical interaction, and collaborates with AR-V7 to up-regulate target oncogenes. Transcriptional coregulation by HoxB13 and AR-V7 was further supported by their coexpression in tumors and circulating tumor cells from CRPC patients. Importantly, HoxB13 silencing significantly decreases CRPC growth through inhibition of AR-V7 oncogenic function.

YAP/TAZ is an important signaling nexus integrating diverse mechanical and biochemical signals, such as ECM stiffness, adhesion ligand density, or cell-cell contacts, and thus strongly influences cell fate. Recent studies show that YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers. However, current understanding of YAP/TAZ remains limited due to the unknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. Furthermore, the multiscale relationship connecting adhesion signaling to YAP/TAZ activity through cytoskeleton dynamics remains poorly understood. To identify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and transduction, we present a, to our knowledge, novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. This model converts extracellular-matrix mechanical properties to biochemical signals via adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with cytoskeleton dynamics. We perform perturbations of molecular levels and sensitivity analyses to predict how various signaling molecules affect YAP/TAZ activity. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue YAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We also found that changes of molecule concentrations result in different patterns of YAP/TAZ stiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to ECM stiffness, and compare with that of SRF/MAL, which is another important regulator of differentiation. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic effect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways can be explained by the interaction of LIM-kinase and LATS. Overall, our model provides a, to our knowledge, novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of integrating different signaling pathways.

Several different aspects of fibrillar collagen, such as stiffness, density, thickness, and pore size, may regulate migration of cancer cells, but determining effects of any one parameter requires clear decoupling of physical properties of collagen networks. The objective of this work is to develop and apply an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) tumor-extra cellular matrix (ECM) model with tunable physical parameters to define how stromal fibroblasts modulate collagen microstructure to control migration of breast cancer cells. We incorporated two different types of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nano-molecules into a collagen/alginate matrix to induce different mechanisms of gelling. The resultant biomimetic, nanocomposite hydrogels show different collagen fibrillar microstructures while maintaining constant overall matrix stiffness, density, and porosimetry. Spheroids of human mammary fibroblasts embedded in these 3D matrices remodel the collagen network to varying extents based on differences in underlying matrix microstructures. The remodeled collagen matrix shows oriented, thicker fibrillar tracks, facilitating invasion of tumor cells. By decoupling effects of matrix stiffness and architecture, our nanocomposite hydrogels serve as robust platforms to investigate how biophysical properties of tumor environments control key processes regulating tumor progression in breast cancer and other malignancies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our manuscript demonstrates a new type of nanocomposite hydrogel with two different gelling mechanisms, produced by incorporating two types of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nano-molecules into a collagen/alginate matrix. The resultant biomimetic hydrogels show different fibrillar collagen microstructures while maintaining constant overall matrix stiffness, density, and porosimetry. These gels allow us to uncouple effects of matrix stiffness versus architecture on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts. Upon embedding spheroids of human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) and dissociated 231 breast cancer cells, we showed that HMFs remodeled the collagen network to differing extents dependent on starting matrix microstructures in each hydrogel.

Using unbiased support vector machine (SVM) learning, we found that density alone is sufficient to predict mesodermal fate. Furthermore, the long-withstanding presentation of spatial confinement during hiPSC differentiation led to an organized vascular tissue, reminiscent of native blood vessels, a process dependent on cell density as found by SVM analysis.

In this study, we explored the clinical impact of intratumor heterogeneity of ER protein expression, HER2 protein expression, and HER2 gene copy number alterations. Using combined immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization on tissue sections followed by a validated computational approach, we analyzed more than 13 000 single tumor cells across 37 HER2+ breast tumors. The samples were taken both before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted treatment, enabling us to study tumor evolution as well. We found that intratumor heterogeneity for HER2 copy number varied substantially between patient samples. Highly heterogeneous tumors were associated with significantly shorter disease-free survival and fewer long-term survivors.

A copy-number genotype predictive of a survival phenotype was only discovered by using the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) formulated as a comparative spectral decomposition. Here, we use the GSVD to compare whole-genome sequencing (WGS) profiles of patient-matched astrocytoma and normal DNA. First, the GSVD uncovers a genome-wide pattern of copy-number alterations, which is bounded by patterns recently uncovered by the GSVDs of microarray-profiled patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) and, separately, lower-grade astrocytoma and normal genomes. Like the microarray patterns, the WGS pattern is correlated with an approximately one-year median survival time. By filling in gaps in the microarray patterns, the WGS pattern reveals that this biologically consistent genotype encodes for transformation via the Notch together with the Ras and Shh pathways. Second, like the GSVDs of the microarray profiles, the GSVD of the WGS profiles separates the tumor-exclusive pattern from normal copy-number variations and experimental inconsistencies.

This requires the completion of a sequence of complex steps including transit, initial arrest, extravasation, survival and proliferation. Increased understanding of the cellular and molecular players enabling each of these steps is key to uncovering new opportunities for therapeutic intervention during early metastatic dissemination. As a protocol extension, this article describes an adaptation to our existing protocol describing a microfluidic platform that offers additional applications. This protocol describes an in vitro model of the human microcirculation with the potential to recapitulate discrete steps of early metastatic seeding, including arrest, transendothelial migration and early micrometastases formation. The microdevice features self-organized human microvascular networks formed over 4-5 d, after which the tumor can be perfused and extravasation events are easily tracked over 72 h via standard confocal microscopy. Contrary to most in vivo and in vitro extravasation assays, robust and rapid scoring of extravascular cells, combined with high-resolution imaging, can be easily achieved because of the confinement of the vascular network to one plane close to the surface of the device. This renders extravascular cells clearly distinct and allows tumor cells of interest to be identified quickly as compared with those in thick tissues. The ability to generate large numbers of devices (∼36) per experiment further allows for highly parametric studies, which are required when testing multiple genetic or pharmacological perturbations. This is coupled with the capability for live tracking of single-cell extravasation events, allowing both tumor and endothelial morphological dynamics to be observed in high detail with a moderate number of data points.",U01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cell Movement|Humans|Microfluidics/methods|Microvessels/anatomy & histology|Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology|Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology","Cell Movement|Humans|Microfluidics/methods|Microvessels/anatomy & histology|Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology|Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology",distant metastasi 90 relat death enabl hematogen dissemin via circul requir complet sequenc complex step transit initi arrest extravas surviv prolifer understand cellular molecular player enabl step key uncov new opportun therapeut intervent earli metastat dissemin protocol extens articl describ adapt exist protocol describ microfluid platform offer addit applic protocol describ vitro model human microcircul recapitul discret step earli metastat seed arrest transendotheli migrat earli micrometastas format microdevic featur self organ human microvascular network form 5 perfus extravas event easili track h via standard confoc microscopi contrari vivo vitro extravas assay robust rapid score extravascular combin high resolut imag easili achiev confin vascular network plane close surfac devic render extravascular clearli distinct allow interest quickli thick tissu abil gener larg number devic per experi allow highli parametr requir test multipl genet pharmacolog perturb coupl capabl live track singl extravas event allow endotheli morpholog dynam high detail moder number points.,Quantitative analyses of tumor cell extravasation

In response, the airway smooth muscle cell undergoes rapid stretch-induced cytoskeletal fluidization. As a molecular mechanism underlying the cytoskeletal fluidization response, we demonstrate a key role for the actin-severing protein cofilin. Using primary human airway smooth muscle cells, we simulated a DI by imposing a transient stretch of physiological magnitude and duration. We used traction microscopy to measure the resulting changes in contractile forces. After a transient stretch, cofilin-knockdown cells exhibited a 29 ± 5% decrease in contractile force compared with prestretch conditions. By contrast, control cells exhibited a 67 ± 6% decrease ( P < 0.05, knockdown vs. control). Consistent with these contractile force changes with transient stretch, actin filaments in cofilin-knockdown cells remained largely intact, whereas actin filaments in control cells were rapidly disrupted. Furthermore, in cofilin-knockdown cells, contractile force at baseline was higher and rate of remodeling poststretch was slower than in control cells. Additionally, the severing action of cofilin was restricted to the release phase of the transient stretch.

Expression of Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) is controlled by genomic imprinting, mediated by silencing of the maternal allele. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 (LOI) is linked to intestinal and colorectal cancers, causally in murine models and epidemiologically in humans. However, the molecular underpinnings of the LOI phenotype are not clear. Surprisingly, in LOI cells, we find a reversal of the relative activities of two canonical signaling pathways triggered by IGF2, causing further rebalancing between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. A predictive mathematical model shows that this network rebalancing quantitatively accounts for the effect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in both WT and LOI cells. This mechanism also quantitatively explains both the stable LOI phenotype and the therapeutic window for selective killing of LOI cells, and thus prevention of epigenetically controlled cancers. These findings suggest a framework for understanding epigenetically modified cell signaling.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Animals|Apoptosis/genetics|Cell Line, Tumor|Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics|Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology|Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Genomic Imprinting/genetics|Humans|Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics|Mice|Phenotype|Signal Transduction","Animals|Apoptosis/genetics|Cell Line, Tumor|Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics|Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology|Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Genomic Imprinting/genetics|Humans|Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics|Mice|Phenotype|Signal Transduction",epigenet control regulatori network partial understood insulin like growth factor ii igf2 control genom imprint mediat silenc matern allel loss imprint igf2 loi link intestin colorect causal murin model epidemiolog human molecular underpin loi phenotyp clear surprisingli loi find revers rel canon signal pathway trigger igf2 caus rebalanc pro anti apoptot signal predict mathemat model network rebalanc quantit account receptor tyrosin kinas inhibit wt loi mechan quantit explain stabl loi phenotyp therapeut window select kill loi thu prevent epigenet control find framework understand epigenet modifi signaling.,Systems Analysis of Phenotypic Switch in Control of Cancer Invasion

Lateral organization of Ras on cellular membranes has long been a subject of intense research; in particular, whether it forms dimers on membranes as part of its regulatory function has been a point of great interest. Here we report Ras dimer formation on membranes by Type II photosensitization reactions, in which molecular oxygen mediates the radicalization of proteins under typical fluorescence experimental conditions. The presence of Ras dimers on membranes was detected by diffusion-based fluorescence techniques including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and single particle tracking, and molecular weights of the stable covalently coupled species were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence spectroscopy implicates interprotein dityrosine as one of the dimerization motifs. The specific surface tyrosine distribution on Ras renders the protein especially sensitive to this reaction, and point mutations affecting surface tyrosines are observed to alter dimerization potential. The photosensitization reactions are reflective of physiological oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species, suggesting such processes may occur naturally and influence signaling pathways in cells.

The poor prognosis is due, in part, to aggressive invasion into the surrounding brain parenchyma. Invasion is a complex process mediated by cell-intrinsic pathways, extrinsic microenvironmental cues, and biophysical cues from the peritumoral stromal matrix. Recent data have attributed GBM invasion to the glioma stem-like cell (GSC) subpopulation. GSCs are slowly dividing, highly invasive, therapy resistant, and are considered to give rise to tumor recurrence. GSCs are localized in a heterogeneous cellular niche, and cross talk between stromal cells and GSCs cultivates a fertile environment that promotes GSC invasion. Pro-migratory soluble factors from endothelial cells, astrocytes, macrophages, microglia, and non-stem-like tumor cells can stimulate peritumoral invasion of GSCs. Therefore, therapeutic efforts designed to target the invasive GSCs may enhance patient survival.

This process is thought to be largely controlled by the action of condensin SMC protein complexes on chromatin fibers. However, how condensins organize metaphase chromosomes is not understood. We have combined micromanipulation of single human mitotic chromosomes, sub-nanonewton force measurement, siRNA interference of condensin subunit expression, and fluorescence microscopy, to analyze the role of condensin in large-scale chromosome organization. Condensin depletion leads to a dramatic (~ 10-fold) reduction in chromosome elastic stiffness relative to the native, non-depleted case. We also find that prolonged metaphase stalling of cells leads to overloading of chromosomes with condensin, with abnormally high chromosome stiffness. These results demonstrate that condensin is a main element controlling the stiffness of mitotic chromosomes.

We used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to examine whether mechanical features of the extracellular microenvironment could differentially modulate mesoderm specification. We found that, on a hydrogel-based compliant matrix, hESCs accumulate β-catenin at cell-cell adhesions and show enhanced Wnt-dependent mesoderm differentiation. Mechanistically, Src-driven ubiquitination of E-cadherin by Cbl-like ubiquitin ligase releases P120-catenin to facilitate transcriptional activity of β-catenin, which initiates and reinforces mesoderm differentiation. By contrast, on a stiff hydrogel matrix, hESCs show elevated integrin-dependent GSK3 and Src activity that promotes β-catenin degradation and inhibits differentiation. Thus, we found that mechanical features of the microenvironmental matrix influence tissue-specific differentiation of hESCs by altering the cellular response to morphogens.",U01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Adherens Junctions/metabolism|Animals|Biomechanical Phenomena|Cadherins/metabolism|Cell Differentiation|Cell Line|Cell Self Renewal|Chick Embryo|Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Human Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology|Human Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism|Humans|Mesoderm/cytology|Mice|Wnt Proteins/metabolism|Wnt Signaling Pathway|beta Catenin/metabolism|src-Family Kinases/metabolism,Adherens Junctions/metabolism|Animals|Biomechanical Phenomena|Cadherins/metabolism|Cell Differentiation|Cell Line|Cell Self Renewal|Chick Embryo|Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition|Extracellular Matrix/metabolism|Human Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology|Human Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism|Humans|Mesoderm/cytology|Mice|Wnt Proteins/metabolism|Wnt Signaling Pathway|beta Catenin/metabolism|src-Family Kinases/metabolism,regen medicin predic understand mechan regul appli condit direct stem fate embryogenesi guid matrix interact unclear physic cue influenc stem cultur human embryon stem hesc examin whether mechan featur extracellular microenviron could differenti modul mesoderm specif hydrogel base compliant matrix hesc accumul β catenin adhes enhanc wnt depend mesoderm differenti mechanist src driven ubiquitin e cadherin cbl like ubiquitin ligas releas p120 catenin facilit transcript β catenin initi reinforc mesoderm differenti contrast stiff hydrogel matrix hesc elev integrin depend gsk3 src promot β catenin degrad inhibit differenti thu mechan featur microenvironment matrix influenc tissu specif differenti hesc alter cellular respons morphogens.,ECM geometrical and mechanical properties modulate RTK signaling

This variability has been a topic of research for several decades and numerous mathematical models have been proposed to explain it. Previously, we developed a top-down, stochastic drift-diffusion+threshold (DDT) model of a cell cycle checkpoint and showed that it can accurately describe experimentally-derived IMT distributions [Leander R, Allen EJ, Garbett SP, Tyson DR, Quaranta V. Derivation and experimental comparison of cell-division probability densities. J. Theor. Biol. 2014;358:129-135]. Here, we use the DDT modeling approach for both descriptive and predictive data analysis. We develop a custom numerical method for the reliable maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters in the absence of a priori knowledge about the number of detectable checkpoints. We employ this method to fit different variants of the DDT model (with one, two, and three checkpoints) to IMT data from multiple cell lines under different growth conditions and drug treatments. We find that a two-checkpoint model best describes the data, consistent with the notion that the cell cycle can be broadly separated into two steps: the commitment to divide and the process of cell division. The model predicts one part of the cell cycle to be highly variable and growth factor sensitive while the other is less variable and relatively refractory to growth factor signaling. Using experimental data that separates IMT into G1 vs. S, G2, and M phases, we show that the model-predicted growth-factor-sensitive part of the cell cycle corresponds to a portion of G1, consistent with previous studies suggesting that the commitment step is the primary source of IMT variability.

However, these multiplexed imaging methods are costly and can degrade both tissue quality and antigenicity with each successive cycle of staining. In addition, computationally intensive image processing such as image registration across multiple channels is required. We have developed a novel method, speedy histopathological-to-immunofluorescent translation (SHIFT) of whole slide images (WSIs) using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). This approach is rooted in the assumption that specific patterns captured in IF images by stains like DAPI, pan-cytokeratin (panCK), or <i>α</i>-smooth muscle actin ( <i>α</i>-SMA) are encoded in H&E images, such that a SHIFT model can learn useful feature representations or architectural patterns in the H&E stain that help generate relevant IF stain patterns. We demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating realistic tumor marker IF WSIs conditioned on corresponding H&E-stained WSIs with up to 94.5% accuracy in a matter of seconds.

We demonstrate that the first and fourth Gal4 binding sites within the UAS do not functionally contribute to promoter activation. Instead, these sites, along with nearby regulatory regions, contribute to the directional regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, Gal4 binding to the third binding site is critical for gene expression, while binding to the other three sites is not sufficient for transcriptional activation.

While the importance of chain charge and resultant electrostatic interactions in controlling conformational properties of IDPs is beginning to be explored through in silico approaches, there is a dearth of experimental studies motivated toward a systematic study of these effects. In an effort to explore this relationship, we measured the conformations of two peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered neurofilament (NF) side arm domain: one depicting the wild-type sequence with four lysine-serine-proline repeats (KSP peptide) and another in which the serine residues were replaced with aspartates (KDP peptide), a strategy sometimes used to mimic phosphorylation. Using a variety of biophysical measurements including a novel application of scanning angle interference microscopy, we demonstrate that the KDP peptide assumes comparatively more expanded conformations in solution and forms significantly thicker brushes when immobilized on planar surfaces at high densities. In both settings, the peptides respond to changes in ambient ionic strength, with each peptide showing distinct stimulus-responsive characteristics. While the KDP peptide undergoes compaction with increasing ionic strength as would be expected for a polyampholyte, the KSP peptide shows biphasic behavior, with an initial compaction followed by an expanded state at a higher ionic strength.

Nevertheless, the relationship between tissue and extracellular matrix stiffness and human breast cancer progression and aggression remains unclear. We undertook a biophysical and biochemical assessment of stromal-epithelial interactions in noninvasive, invasive and normal adjacent human breast tissue and in breast cancers of increasingly aggressive subtype. Our analysis revealed that human breast cancer transformation is accompanied by an incremental increase in collagen deposition and a progressive linearization and thickening of interstitial collagen. The linearization of collagen was visualized as an overall increase in tissue birefringence and was most striking at the invasive front of the tumor where the stiffness of the stroma and cellular mechanosignaling were the highest. Amongst breast cancer subtypes we found that the stroma at the invasive region of the more aggressive Basal-like and Her2 tumor subtypes was the most heterogeneous and the stiffest when compared to the less aggressive luminal A and B subtypes. Intriguingly, we quantified the greatest number of infiltrating macrophages and the highest level of TGF beta signaling within the cells at the invasive front. We also established that stroma stiffness and the level of cellular TGF beta signaling positively correlated with each other and with the number of infiltrating tumor-activated macrophages, which was highest in the more aggressive tumor subtypes.

These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. These tumors can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast the manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential.

Although the efficiency of oxygenation of these substrates by COX-2 in vitro is similar, cellular biosynthesis of PGs far exceeds that of PG-Gs. Evidence that the COX enzymes are functional heterodimers suggests that competitive interaction of AA and 2-AG at the allosteric site of COX-2 might result in differential regulation of the oxygenation of the two substrates when both are present. Modulation of AA levels in RAW264.7 macrophages uncovered an inverse correlation between cellular AA levels and PG-G biosynthesis. In vitro kinetic analysis using purified protein demonstrated that the inhibition of 2-AG oxygenation by high concentrations of AA far exceeded the inhibition of AA oxygenation by high concentrations of 2-AG. An unbiased systems-based mechanistic model of the kinetic data revealed that binding of AA or 2-AG at the allosteric site of COX-2 results in a decreased catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward 2-AG, whereas 2-AG binding at the allosteric site increases COX-2's efficiency toward AA. The results suggest that substrates interact with COX-2 via multiple potential complexes involving binding to both the catalytic and allosteric sites. Competition between AA and 2-AG for these sites, combined with differential allosteric modulation, gives rise to a complex interplay between the substrates, leading to preferential oxygenation of AA.

To investigate this, we synthesize an actomyosin material in vitro whose active stress content can tune the network from stable to contractile. Each increment in activity determines a characteristic spectrum of actin filament fluctuations which is used to calculate the total mechanical work and the production of entropy in the material. We find that the balance of work and entropy does not increase monotonically and the entropy production rate is maximized in the non-contractile, stable state of actomyosin.

The aggressive invasion of the surrounding normal brain makes complete surgical resection impossible, increases the resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and assures tumor recurrence. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative therapeutics to target the invasive tumor cells for improved treatment outcomes of this disease. Expression of TROY (TNFRSF19), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, increases with increasing glial tumor grade and inversely correlates with patient survival. Increased expression of TROY stimulates glioblastoma cell invasion <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing TROY expression inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion, increases temozolomide sensitivity, and prolongs survival in an intracranial xenograft model. Here, a novel complex is identified between TROY and EGFR, which is mediated predominantly by the cysteine-rich CRD3 domain of TROY. Glioblastoma tumors with elevated TROY expression have a statistically positive correlation with increased EGFR expression. TROY expression significantly increases the capacity of EGF to stimulate glioblastoma cell invasion, whereas depletion of TROY expression blocks EGF stimulation of glioblastoma cell invasion. Mechanistically, TROY expression modulates EGFR signaling by facilitating EGFR activation and delaying EGFR receptor internalization. Moreover, the association of EGFR with TROY increases TROY-induced NF-κB activation. These findings substantiate a critical role for the TROY-EGFR complex in regulation of glioblastoma cell invasion.<b>Implications:</b> The TROY-EGFR signaling complex emerges as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit glioblastoma cell invasion. <i>Mol Cancer Res; 16(2); 322-32. ©2017 AACR</i>.",U01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Binding Sites|Brain Neoplasms/genetics|Brain Neoplasms/metabolism|Cell Line, Tumor|Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism|ErbB Receptors/genetics|ErbB Receptors/metabolism|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Humans|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/chemistry|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism|Signal Transduction|Up-Regulation","Binding Sites|Brain Neoplasms/genetics|Brain Neoplasms/metabolism|Cell Line, Tumor|Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism|ErbB Receptors/genetics|ErbB Receptors/metabolism|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Glioblastoma/genetics|Glioblastoma/metabolism|Humans|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/chemistry|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics|Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism|Signal Transduction|Up-Regulation",glioblastoma frequent primari brain adult highli lethal malign median surviv month aggress invas surround normal brain make complet surgic resect imposs resist radiat chemotherapi assur recurr thu urgent need innov therapeut target invas improv treatment outcom diseas troy tnfrsf19 member necrosi factor tnf receptor famili glial grade invers correl patient surviv troy stimul glioblastoma invas vitro vivo resist temozolomid radiat therapi convers silenc troy inhibit glioblastoma invas temozolomid sensit prolong surviv intracrani xenograft model novel complex troy egfr mediat predominantli cystein rich crd3 domain troy glioblastoma elev troy statist posit correl egfr troy significantli capac egf stimul glioblastoma invas wherea deplet troy block egf stimul glioblastoma invas mechanist troy modul egfr signal facilit egfr delay egfr receptor intern moreov egfr troy troy induc nf κb find substanti critic role troy egfr complex regul glioblastoma invas implic troy egfr signal complex emerg therapeut target inhibit glioblastoma invas mol 16 322 aacr,Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma

Following contact between two epithelial monolayers expressing, respectively, EphB2 and its ligand ephrinB1, both monolayers exhibit oscillatory patterns of traction forces and intercellular stresses that tend to pull cell-matrix adhesions away from the boundary. With time, monolayers jam, accompanied by the emergence of deformation waves that propagate away from the boundary.

During treatment, these carriers may extravasate through pores in the tumor vasculature that form during angiogenesis. We provide an analytical, computational, and experimental examination of the extravasation of point particles (e.g., drug molecules) and finite-sized spheroidal particles. We study the advection-diffusion process in a model microvasculature, consisting of a shear flow over and a pressure-driven suction flow into a circular pore in a flat surface. For point particles, we provide an analytical formula [Formula: see text] for the dimensionless Sherwood number S, i.e., the extravasation rate, in terms of the pore entry resistance (Damköhler number κ), the shear rate (Péclet number P), and the suction flow rate (suction strength Q). Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations verify this result, and our simulations are then extended to include finite-sized NPs, in which no analytical solutions are available. BD simulations indicate that particles of different geometries have drastically different extravasation rates in different flow conditions. In general, extreme aspect ratio particles provide a greater flux through the pore because of favorable alignment with streamlines entering the pore and less hindered interaction with the pore. We validate the BD simulations by measuring the in vitro transport of both bacteriophage MS2 (a spherical NP) and free dye (a model drug molecule) across a porous membrane. Despite their vastly different sizes, BD predicts S = 8.53 E-4 and S = 27.6 E-4, and our experiments agree favorably, with S<sub>exp</sub>=10.6 E-4± 1.75 E-4 and S<sub>exp</sub>=16.3 E-4 ± 3.09 E-4, for MS2 and free dye, respectively, thus demonstrating the practical utility of our simulation framework.",U54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blood Vessels/metabolism|Molecular Probes/chemistry|Molecular Probes/metabolism|Nanoparticles|Particle Size|Porosity,Blood Vessels/metabolism|Molecular Probes/chemistry|Molecular Probes/metabolism|Nanoparticles|Particle Size|Porosity,modern treatment interest drug molecul either directli inject bloodstream deliv nanoparticl np carrier variou shape size treatment carrier extravas pore vasculatur form angiogenesi provid analyt comput experiment examin extravas point particl e.g drug molecul finit size spheroid particl advect diffus process model microvasculatur consist shear flow pressur driven suction flow circular pore flat surfac point particl provid analyt formula formula see text dimensionless sherwood number i.e extravas rate term pore entri resist damköhler number κ shear rate péclet number p suction flow rate suction strength q brownian dynam bd simul verifi simul extend finit size np analyt solut avail bd simul indic particl differ geometri drastic differ extravas rate differ flow condit gener extrem aspect ratio particl provid greater flux pore favor align streamlin enter pore less hinder interact pore valid bd simul measur vitro transport bacteriophag ms2 spheric np free dye model drug molecul across porou membran despit vastli differ size bd predict e e experi agre favor exp 10 e e exp 16 e 3 e ms2 free dye respect thu practic util simul framework.,Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology

GBM is notable for a highly infiltrative growth pattern and several groups have reported that high Fn14 expression levels can increase tumor cell invasiveness. We reported previously that the mesenchymal and proneural GBM transcriptomic subtypes expressed the highest and lowest levels of Fn14 mRNA, respectively. Given the recent histopathological re-classification of human gliomas by the World Health Organization based on isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation status, we extended this work by comparing Fn14 gene expression in IDH1 wild-type (WT) and mutant (R132H) gliomas and in cell lines engineered to overexpress the IDH1 R132H enzyme. We found that both low-grade and high-grade (i.e., GBM) IDH1 R132H gliomas exhibit low Fn14 mRNA and protein levels compared to IDH1 WT gliomas. Forced overexpression of the IDH1 R132H protein in glioma cells reduced Fn14 expression, while treatment of IDH1 R132H-overexpressing cells with the IDH1 R132H inhibitor AGI-5198 or the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased Fn14 expression.

Recent work demonstrates an intimate connection between nuclear compartmentalization and gene regulation. Here, we report that Ser62 phosphorylation and PIN1-mediated isomerization of MYC dynamically regulate the spatial distribution of MYC in the nucleus, promoting its association with the inner basket of the nuclear pore in response to proliferative signals, where it recruits the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to bind and regulate local gene acetylation and expression. We demonstrate that PIN1-mediated localization of MYC to the nuclear pore regulates MYC target genes responsive to mitogen stimulation that are involved in proliferation and migration pathways. These changes are also present at the chromatin level, with an increase in open regulatory elements in response to stimulation that is PIN1-dependent and associated with MYC chromatin binding.

Defects in this function contribute to wound reoccurrence causing significant clinical problems. Several in vitro studies have shown that the speed of migrating keratinocytes can be regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) which affects keratinocyte's integrin expression. The relationship between integrin expression (through cell-matrix adhesion) stimulated by EGF and keratinocyte migration speed is not linear since increased adhesion, due to increased integrin expression, has been experimentally shown to slow down cell migration due to the biphasic dependence of cell speed on adhesion. In our previous work we showed that keratinocytes that were co-cultured with EGF-enhanced fibroblasts formed an asymmetric migration pattern, where, the cumulative distances of keratinocytes migrating toward fibroblasts were smaller than those migrating away from fibroblasts. This asymmetric pattern is thought to be provoked by high EGF concentration secreted by fibroblasts. The EGF stimulates the expression of integrin receptors on the surface of keratinocytes migrating toward fibroblasts via paracrine signaling. In this paper, we present a computational model of keratinocyte migration that is controlled by EGF secreted by fibroblasts using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM). Our computational simulation results confirm the asymmetric pattern observed in experiments. These results provide a deeper insight into our understanding of the complexity of keratinocyte migration in the presence of growth factor gradients and may explain re-epithelialization failure in impaired wound healing.",U01,,,not reported,Not Applicable,,,,,,,,metastasis,,,,,,"Cell Adhesion|Cell Line|Cell Movement|Coculture Techniques|Collagen/chemistry|Computer Simulation|Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism|Epithelium/metabolism|Fibroblasts/metabolism|Humans|Integrins/metabolism|Keratinocytes/cytology|Models, Theoretical|Paracrine Communication|Re-Epithelialization|Signal Transduction|Skin/metabolism|Stress, Mechanical","Cell Adhesion|Cell Line|Cell Movement|Coculture Techniques|Collagen/chemistry|Computer Simulation|Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism|Epithelium/metabolism|Fibroblasts/metabolism|Humans|Integrins/metabolism|Keratinocytes/cytology|Models, Theoretical|Paracrine Communication|Re-Epithelialization|Signal Transduction|Skin/metabolism|Stress, Mechanical",wide agre keratinocyt migrat play crucial role wound epitheli defect function contribut wound reoccurr caus clinic problem sever vitro speed migrat keratinocyt regul epiderm growth factor egf affect keratinocyt integrin relationship integrin matrix adhes stimul egf keratinocyt migrat speed linear sinc adhes due integrin experiment slow migrat due biphas depend speed adhes previou work keratinocyt co cultur egf enhanc fibroblast form asymmetr migrat pattern cumul distanc keratinocyt migrat toward fibroblast smaller migrat away fibroblast asymmetr pattern thought provok high egf concentr secret fibroblast egf stimul integrin receptor surfac keratinocyt migrat toward fibroblast via paracrin signal paper present comput model keratinocyt migrat control egf secret fibroblast cellular pott model cpm comput simul confirm asymmetr pattern experi provid deeper insight understand complex keratinocyt migrat presenc growth factor gradient explain epitheli failur impair wound healing.,Epithelial layer jamming in breast cancer cell migration

These cooperative motions are driven by active cellular forces, but the physical nature of these forces and how they generate collective cellular motion remain poorly understood. Here, we study forces and motions in a confined epithelial monolayer and make two experimental observations: 1) the direction of local cellular motion deviates systematically from the direction of the local traction exerted by each cell upon its substrate; and 2) oscillating waves of cellular motion arise spontaneously. Based on these observations, we propose a theory that connects forces and motions using two internal state variables, one of which generates an effective cellular polarization, and the other, through contractile forces, an effective cellular inertia. In agreement with theoretical predictions, drugs that inhibit contractility reduce both the cellular effective elastic modulus and the frequency of oscillations. Together, theory and experiment provide evidence suggesting that collective cellular motion is driven by at least two internal variables that serve to sustain waves and to polarize local cellular traction in a direction that deviates systematically from local cellular velocity.

A genome-wide tumor-exclusive pattern of DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) is revealed, encompassed in that previously uncovered in glioblastoma (GBM), i.e., grade IV astrocytoma, where GBM-specific CNAs encode for enhanced opportunities for transformation and proliferation via growth and developmental signaling pathways in GBM relative to LGA. The GSVD separates the LGA pattern from other sources of biological and experimental variation, common to both, or exclusive to one of the tumor and normal datasets. We find, first, and computationally validate, that the LGA pattern is correlated with a patient's survival and response to treatment. Second, the GBM pattern identifies among the LGA patients a subtype, statistically indistinguishable from that among the GBM patients, where the CNA genotype is correlated with an approximately one-year survival phenotype. Third, cross-platform classification of the Affymetrix-measured LGA and GBM profiles by using the Agilent-derived GBM pattern shows that the GBM pattern is a platform-independent predictor of astrocytoma outcome. Statistically, the pattern is a better predictor (corresponding to greater median survival time difference, proportional hazard ratio, and concordance index) than the patient's age and the tumor's grade, which are the best indicators of astrocytoma currently in clinical use, and laboratory tests. The pattern is also statistically independent of these indicators, and, combined with either one, is an even better predictor of astrocytoma outcome. Recurring DNA CNAs have been observed in astrocytoma tumors' genomes for decades, however, copy-number subtypes that are predictive of patients' outcomes were not identified before. This is despite the growing number of datasets recording different aspects of the disease, and due to an existing fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can simultaneously find similarities and dissimilarities across the datasets.

This PEG/Collagen IPN platform is cytocompatible, inherently bioactive via native cellular adhesion sites, and mechanically tunable over several orders of magnitude-mimicking both healthy and cancerous breast tissue.

We found that young dermal fibroblasts secrete high levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents, including proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and cartilage-linking proteins. The most abundantly secreted was HAPLN1, a hyaluronic and proteoglycan link protein. HAPLN1 was lost in aged fibroblasts, resulting in a more aligned ECM that promoted metastasis of melanoma cells. Reconstituting HAPLN1 inhibited metastasis in an aged microenvironment, in 3-D skin reconstruction models, and <i>in vivo</i>. Intriguingly, aged fibroblast-derived matrices had the opposite effect on the migration of T cells, inhibiting their motility. HAPLN1 treatment of aged fibroblasts restored motility of mononuclear immune cells, while impeding that of polymorphonuclear immune cells, which in turn affected regulatory T-cell recruitment. These data suggest that although age-related physical changes in the ECM can promote tumor cell motility, they may adversely affect the motility of some immune cells, resulting in an overall change in the immune microenvironment. Understanding the physical changes in aging skin may provide avenues for more effective therapy for older patients with melanoma.

Here we discover that tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer is driven by a regulatory axis consisting of a master transcription factor, its cofactor, and an epigenetic regulator. The oncogenic histone methyltransferase EZH2 conferred tamoxifen resistance by silencing the expression of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) cofactor GREB1. In clinical specimens, induction of DNA methylation of a particular CpG-enriched region at the <i>GREB1</i> promoter negatively correlated with <i>GREB1</i> levels and cell sensitivity to endocrine agents. GREB1 also ensured proper cellular reactions to different ligands by recruiting distinct sets of ERα cofactors to <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, which explains the contradictory biological effects of GREB1 on breast cancer cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogen. In refractory cells, EZH2-dependent repression of GREB1 triggered chromatin reallocation of ERα coregulators, converting the antiestrogen into an agonist. In clinical specimens from patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, expression levels of EZH2 and GREB1 were correlated negatively, and taken together better predicted patient responses to endocrine therapy.

In order to investigate the role of IDH mutations in immune response, we created a syngeneic pair mouse model for mutant IDH1 (muIDH1) and wtIDH1 gliomas and demonstrated that muIDH1 mice showed many molecular and clinical similarities to muIDH1 human gliomas, including a 100-fold higher concentration of 2-hydroxygluratate (2-HG), longer survival time, and higher CpG methylation compared with wtIDH1. Also, we showed that IDH1 mutations caused down-regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, resulting in repression of the tumor-associated immune system.

Because of the stochastic nature of genetic alterations, this intratumoral heterogeneity is often viewed as chaotic. Here we show that the altered metabolism of cancer cells creates predictable gradients of extracellular metabolites that orchestrate the phenotypic diversity of cells in the tumor microenvironment. Combining experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that metabolites consumed and secreted within the tumor microenvironment induce tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to differentiate into distinct subpopulations according to local levels of ischemia and their position relative to the vasculature. TAMs integrate levels of hypoxia and lactate into progressive activation of MAPK signaling that induce predictable spatial patterns of gene expression, such as stripes of macrophages expressing arginase 1 (ARG1) and mannose receptor, C type 1 (MRC1). These phenotypic changes are functionally relevant as ischemic macrophages triggered tube-like morphogenesis in neighboring endothelial cells that could restore blood perfusion in nutrient-deprived regions where angiogenic resources are most needed. We propose that gradients of extracellular metabolites act as tumor morphogens that impose order within the microenvironment, much like signaling molecules convey positional information to organize embryonic tissues.

Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in single cells.

Immune checkpoint protein TIGIT-expressing T cells were more frequent in DCIS, whereas high PD-L1 expression and amplification of <i>CD274</i> (encoding PD-L1) was only detected in triple-negative IDCs. Coamplification of a 17q12 chemokine cluster with <i>ERBB2</i> subdivided HER2<sup>+</sup> breast tumors into immunologically and clinically distinct subtypes.

The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of these treatments is often countered by the acquisition of drug resistance. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie acquired resistance to BRAFi and to the combined therapy. Consistent with previous studies, we show that resistance to BRAFi is mediated by ERK pathway reactivation. Resistance to the combined therapy, however, is mediated by mechanisms independent of reactivation of ERK in many resistant cell lines and clinical samples. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) become activated in cells with acquired drug resistance and have a pivotal role in mediating resistance. Our screening, using a reverse-phase protein array, revealed distinct mechanisms by which PAKs mediate resistance to BRAFi and the combined therapy. In BRAFi-resistant cells, PAKs phosphorylate CRAF and MEK to reactivate ERK. In cells that are resistant to the combined therapy, PAKs regulate JNK and β-catenin phosphorylation and mTOR pathway activation, and inhibit apoptosis, thereby bypassing ERK. Together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired drug resistance to current targeted therapies, and may help to direct novel drug development efforts to overcome acquired drug resistance.",U54,"syn12976725,syn12976726",syn12976724,skin,Melanoma,RPPA,,"GSE96753, GSE96902",PAK signaling<U+00A0>and drug resistance,10.1038/nature24040,skin,University of Pennsylvania,,,,,,,"Animals|Apoptosis/drug effects|Cell Line, Tumor|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enzyme Activation/drug effects|Female|Humans|JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/chemistry|JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism|MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects|Melanoma/drug therapy|Melanoma/enzymology|Melanoma/genetics|Mice|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/chemistry|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors|Mutation|Phosphorylation/drug effects|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology|Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/chemistry|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism|Signal Transduction/drug effects|TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism|beta Catenin/chemistry|beta Catenin/metabolism|p21-Activated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors|p21-Activated Kinases/genetics|p21-Activated Kinases/metabolism","Animals|Apoptosis/drug effects|Cell Line, Tumor|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects|Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics|Enzyme Activation/drug effects|Female|Humans|JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/chemistry|JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism|MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects|Melanoma/drug therapy|Melanoma/enzymology|Melanoma/genetics|Mice|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/chemistry|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors|Mutation|Phosphorylation/drug effects|Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology|Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/chemistry|Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism|Signal Transduction/drug effects|TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism|beta Catenin/chemistry|beta Catenin/metabolism|p21-Activated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors|p21-Activated Kinases/genetics|p21-Activated Kinases/metabolism",target braf inhibit brafi combin braf mek inhibit brafi meki therapi markedli improv clinic outcom patient metastat melanoma unfortun efficaci treatment often counter acquisit drug resist investig molecular mechan underli acquir resist brafi combin therapi consist previou resist brafi mediat erk pathway reactiv resist combin therapi mediat mechan independ reactiv erk mani resist line clinic sampl p21 kinas pak becom acquir drug resist pivot role mediat resist screen revers phase array reveal distinct mechan pak mediat resist brafi combin therapi brafi resist pak phosphoryl craf mek reactiv erk resist combin therapi pak regul jnk β catenin phosphoryl mtor pathway inhibit apoptosi therebi bypass erk togeth provid insight molecular mechan underli acquir drug resist current target therapi help direct novel drug effort overcom acquir drug resistance.,Physical Science Oncology Center at Penn

We applied this method to analyzing single cells from two types of hematopoietic cells, K562 and GM12878 and small populations of fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells. The method detected 21 798 CGIs (76% of all CGIs) per cell, and the number of CGIs consistently detected from all 16 profiled single cells was 20 864 (72.7%), with 12 961 promoters covered. This coverage represents a substantial improvement over results obtained using single cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, with a 66-fold increase in the fraction of consistently profiled CGIs across individual cells. Single cells of the same type were more similar to each other than to other types, but also displayed epigenetic heterogeneity. The method was further validated by comparing the CpG methylation pattern, methylation profile of CGIs/promoters and repeat regions and 41 classes of known regulatory markers to the ENCODE data.

Nevertheless, during tumor evolution cancers engage a variety of protective pathways, which may provide alternative actionable dependencies. Here, we identify a promising combination therapy that kills <i>NF1</i>-mutant tumors by triggering catastrophic oxidative stress. Specifically, we show that mTOR and HDAC inhibitors kill aggressive nervous system malignancies and shrink tumors <i>in vivo</i> by converging on the TXNIP/thioredoxin antioxidant pathway, through cooperative effects on chromatin and transcription. Accordingly, TXNIP triggers cell death by inhibiting thioredoxin and activating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Moreover, this drug combination also kills <i>NF1</i>-mutant and <i>KRAS</i>-mutant non-small cell lung cancers. Together, these studies identify a promising therapeutic combination for several currently untreatable malignancies and reveal a protective nodal point of convergence between these important epigenetic and oncogenic enzymes.<b>Significance:</b> There are no effective therapies for <i>NF1</i>- or <i>RAS</i>-mutant cancers.
