Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST)	Project	1	"Elucidating the regulatory logic that is responsible for maintaining cancer cell state, independent of specific initiating events and endogenous/exogenous perturbations"	"'[In project 1](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/cast-project-1), CaST is attempting to move beyond current approaches for elucidating tumor checkpoints and master regulators, which are largely static and not designed to predict how tumors respond to pharmacological and genomic perturbations over time. Thus, we are developing novel methodologies to mechanistically uncover the regulatory machinery that maintains cancer cell state and governs cell state transition. We are also working to define the role of regulatory networks in implementing distinct tumor phenotypes, from metastatic progression, to immunoevasion, to drug resistance. This effort will leverage and integrate time-course data from gene expression and computationally inferred protein activity profiles, generated by small molecules and RNAi/CRISPR perturbations.'"
Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST)	Project	2	Elucidating time-dependent mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic reprogramming of individual cancer cells underlying cancer-state transitions to drug resistance and progression	"'[In project 2](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/cast-project-2), we are investigating cell state plasticity and tumor/microenvironment heterogeneity, which represent formidable obstacles to successful treatment of human malignancies. This interest is driven by a growing awareness that tumors can harbor distinct niches that include genetically distinct subclones (which have identical or distinct tumor checkpoints), as well as isogenic niches (which present with orthogonal checkpoints). Our goal is to compile a comprehensive inventory of tumor dependencies among such heterogeneous niches that can be targeted pharmacologically, We are studying these mechanisms by developing new methods to identify distinct tumor compartments and heterogeneity at the single-cell level.'"
Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST)	Project	3	Developing novel methodologies for the systematic prioritization of compounds and compound combinations capable of abrogating tumorigenesis in vivo	"'[In project 3](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/cast-project-3), we are developing and validating computational methods for the prioritization of master regulator-targeting drugs and drug combinations to either implement or prevent specific tumor state transitions. This includes inducing irreversible commitment to cell death, preventing progression to a malignant tumor stage, and rescuing drug sensitivity. In addition, we are attempting to address a broad range of questions related to the heterogeneity of tumor response, including mechanisms that allow tumor cells to compensate for MR-targeted therapy. We propose that addressing tumor plasticity and potential escape routes implemented by tumor state reprograming is going to be critically relevant for the chronic management of cancer in patients.'"

CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC	Project	1	Tumor-specific T cell state dynamics and heterogeneity in early tumorigenesis	"'CD8 T cells are powerful components of the immune system that have the potential to selectively eradicate cancer cells. However, in most patients, tumors progress relentlessly despite the presence of tumor-specific CD8 T cells. We developed a genetic cancer mouse model that faithfully mirrors cancer development in patients and revealed that tumor-specific CD8 T cells enter a state of dysfunction early during tumorigenesis. These T cells exhibited the hallmarks of dysfunctional T cells from late-stage human tumors. Early after tumor initiation, T cell dysfunction was plastic, but at later times, became fixed. Breakthrough therapies (immune checkpoint blockade) have emerged to reverse T cell dysfunction but these strategies have only worked in a subset of patients and a subset of tumor types. The goal of Project 1 is to understand the co-evolutionary cancer cell, stromal and immune population dynamics that control T cell differentiation to different functional states and consequently, T cell sensitivity to immunotherapeutic interventions. We will leverage the power of clinically-relevant genetic cancer mouse models to dissect the complex interplay of cancer genomic evolution, immune and stromal cell population dynamics, and the molecular mechanisms controlling CD8 T cell differentiation using innovative single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic analytic tools and powerful mathematical modeling approaches. By bringing together considerable expertise in cancer immune mouse modeling, computational methods, and clinical immune checkpoint blockade therapy, these approaches will provide new insights into T cell differentiation and could reveal novel strategies to unleash the precise power of tumor-specific CD8 T cells for cancer immunotherapy.'"
CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC	Project	2	The tumor ecosystem in cancer progression and immunotherapeutic response	"'The goal of Project 2 is to identify the ecological interactions between cancer and immune cells that govern cancer dynamics and response to therapy. We start from the idea that a tumor can be considered an ecosystem or organ, where multiple accessory cell types are interconnected and communicate with each other and with tumor cells, which serve as their clients. Through systems analysis and modeling of functional interactions in the tumor ecosystem on different scales including cellular, protein, metabolite, and gene expression dynamics at a population and single cell levels this proposal will seek to identify key cellular and molecular regulatory elements in the tumor microenvironment and potential means of their manipulation for therapeutic benefit. We will a) explore features of, and relationships between, multiple accessory cell types and tumor cells, in experimental models of skin and lung cancer in mice and in human cancer patients; b) use perturbation of the tumor ecology impacting its progression in mice and human patients by established and novel immunotherapeutic modalities including PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade and Treg cell depletion; c) validate key interaction components in the tumor ecosystem by modeling cell-cell interactions _in vitro_ using tissue mimetic systems and _in silico_ using agent-based models.'"
CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC	Project	3	Latent metastasis: immune regulation of disseminated cancer stem cells	"'The goal of Project 3 is to discover mechanisms that critically regulate immune evasion by disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and their evolution as latent metastatic entities. We will use an integrated approach that combines single-cell interrogation methods with unique biological models of latent metastasis from breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, and novel computational strategies. Distant metastasis underlies the overwhelming majority of cancer-related deaths and its inception is exceedingly variable. Residual DTCs may outgrow immediately or, more frequently, linger in a viable state of replicative quiescence or mass dormancy for months to years after infiltrating distant organs. This latency state of DTCs is accompanied with significant resistance to anti-neoplastic therapy, which typically targets actively dividing tumor cells. Moreover, latent DTCs somehow evade immune surveillance. The biology underlying these adaptive abilities remains poorly understood and factors governing DTC population dynamics, whether stochastic or deterministic, remain unknown. We aim to address this significant knowledge gap by combining massively parallel, single-cell RNA expression profiling using a bead-based molecular barcoding technology with unsupervised learning methods to identify stable/transitory cell states within latent, residual disease and their molecular control mechanisms. As a complementary approach, individual cell responses to molecular perturbations will be dynamically tracked by live cell imaging.'"

Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology	Project	1	Murine modeling of tumor-mediated immunosuppression	"'We hypothesize that lymph node (LN) metastasis constitutes an essential step in the metastatic cascade of melanomas and head and neck tumors in that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the nodes to induce tolerance to the tumor and that leukocytes recirculating from these nodes carry the tolerance to distant sites. Our objectives are to establish whether LN metastases induce perturbations in anti-tumor immunity and to identify the mechanisms of these perturbations. We will a) characterize differences in local and systemic immune responses to metastatic tumors; b) identify differential regulators of tolerance induction by metastatic cells through the use of genomic profiling; and c) identify the molecular mediators of metastatic tolerance induction in mice and humans. Through the use of serial in vivo passaging, we have developed a panel of syngeneic melanoma cell lines that exhibit enhanced LN metastatic potential. We will compare the activation states of these immune cells, cytokine profiles, T cell polarization, and cytolytic activity toward tumor cells using single cell proteomic methods (Project 2). Using cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing on the lines, we will apply computational systems biology approaches (Project 3) to identify the molecules relevant for induction of tolerance. If our hypothesis is proven correct that LN metastasis is an obligate step in the generation of systemic disease due to tolerance induction, targeting the molecules responsible for LN metastasis induced tolerance could prevent and treat metastatic disease.'"
Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology	Project	2	Spatial architecture of tumor-mediated immunosuppression	"'Beyond the internal genomic and epigenetic events that occur to drive a cell towards outright carcinogenesis and then metastasis, there co-exist the ordered events a cancer imposes on immune cells it encounters on its progression towards advanced disease. Induction of tolerance, avoidance of apoptosis, and even recruitment of the immune system to aid a tumor’s growth are all poorly understood processes. We propose to undertake deep phenotyping of the 2D and 3D architecture of tumour-lymph node micro-environment—wherein it is expected some of the initial phases of the tumor’s avoidance and recruitment mechanisms are implemented. How is the architecture of the immune environment disrupted in the face of tumor metastasis? Are their micro-communities (as defined by particular cell-cell interactions) whose presence or absence defines an outcome in progression of the tumor? To this end we have developed a technology (ABSeq) that enables us to sensitively and quantitatively image tumors with 60 markers per 3 hours (scalable to 480 in a time-dependent manner) with markers selected from a range of intracellular or surface epitopes (recognized by antibodies) or RNAs. The hypothesis is that an orchestrated corruption of immune surveillance is initiated by cancers as they progress, and that the micro-scale architecture of the lymph node (by way of which cells are talking to whom and what broader effects occur across the lymph node and beyond) is disrupted in a defined manner. A major aim of the research is to, with ABSeq, define the 2D and 3D architecture and communities of immune and cancer cells in draining lymph nodes from 2 cancers (melanoma and head and neck cancer) in murine models and with human samples. Databases of 2D and 3D microenvironments will be publicly created and mined for associations that define the architectural changes that occur as tumors progress and initiate tolerance.'"
Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology	Project	3	Integrative computational modeling of tumor-mediated immunosuppression	"'We will develop and apply computational tools to integrate the complex datasets generated by our Center in order to identify candidate mediators of tumor-immune interactions that induce immunosuppression for functional validation. To enrich our ability for interpretation, we will explore signatures of the immune system in a pan-cancer analysis using the TCGA datasets annotated with time to distant metastasis, in the context of node-negative and nodepositive patients. We hypothesize that pan-cancer genes whose expression is strongly associated with time to distant metastasis are more likely to be associated with tumor-intrinsic or microenvironmental processes driving metastasis progression, thus we will prioritize these genes in our integrative computational analysis of our melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma datasets. Using the RNAseq data generated by our study, we will develop and apply novel network-based computational methods for reconstructing the interactions between malignant and immune subpopulations. Moreover, we will develop and apply new approaches to integrate the spatial information from high dimensional single cell in situ images from Project 2 with the gene expression datasets to further refine our inferences of candidate mediators of immunosuppression. The datasets and computational resources developed by our Project, and Center at large, will not only enable use to deeply explore the role of lymph nodes in tumor-mediated immunosuppression, but will also provide the community with powerful resources for understanding systemic influences on the forces governing metastatic dissemination.'"
Stanford University Center for Cancer Systems Biology	Core	1	Biospecimen and Data Management	"'Our Biospecimen and Data Management Core will be utilized by all the Research Projects in our Center. All three Research Projects aim to identify mechanisms by which tumor cells, metastatic to regional lymph nodes, interface with the host immune system to perturb systemic immunity to induce global immune tolerance. While we will methodically study this process in murine models (Project 1), analysis of human tumor and lymph node specimens is paramount for two primary reasons. The first reason is to ensure the translation of the murine discovery approach to human disease. The second reason is to facilitate the discovery of critical mediators of tumor-induced immunosuppression directly from the human samples, then follow with functional validation in our murine models. Hence it is critical that we establish the necessary infrastructure to procure viable human tumor specimens and autologous immune tumorinfiltrating immune cells. Importantly, matched sets of fresh primary tumor cells, metastatic tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (from the primary tumor and the lymph nodes) and circulating immune cells will be collected to address the hypotheses and goals of the Research Projects. Furthermore, in this shared core, a database of clinical annotation (aka clinical metadata) for these matched samples will be created and maintained. This clinical metadata is critical for interpretation of our molecular and imaging data given tumor and patient heterogeneity and will likely provide important insight into how the data generated by the proposed projects may be used to guide treatment and predict outcome.

Systems Analysis of Phenotypic Switch in Control of Cancer Invasion	Project	1	Analysis of Cell Autonomous Mechanisms of Phenotypic Plasticity in Invasive Cell Spread	"'The goal of this project is to obtain a better quantitative understanding of the complex regulation and characteristic of the invasive phenotypic state. The analysis in the project is aimed at the cell autonomous view of regulation, without explicit emphasis of cell-cell interactions. We will combine a variety of tools and approaches, including combining experimentation and mathematical modeling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are able to separate slow moving, proliferative cells from fast moving, migratory cells (and enrich each phenotype) using a “phenotypic filter” through an assay called Rapid Analysis of Cell migration Enhancement (RACE). This assay employs nano-fabricated surfaces that result in rapid and highly oriented cell migration. Preliminary results using RACE not only suggest that the assay can help identify molecular mechanisms of the Proliferative-to-Aggressive phenotypic switch but have also led us to develop a preliminary mathematical model describing how specific kinases, thought to be activated by the same growth factors, can be differentially active in different cell sub-populations. In addition, using synthetic biology techniques, we have created a new platform for generating novel kinase inhibitors that can be used to, for the first time, target kinases considered to be “difficult” to target due to their orphan status and unclear regulation mechanisms. When possible, the mechanistic significance in cancer invasion and spreading of newly identified and targeted kinases will be examined using biophysical approaches that can determine whether and how cytoskeletally-mediated processes leading to cell migration have been triggered.'"
Systems Analysis of Phenotypic Switch in Control of Cancer Invasion	Project	2	Analysis of Non-Cell-Autonomous (Cell Communication-Dependent) Mechanisms of Phenotypic Plasticity in Invasive Cell Spread	"'Preliminary data from the RACE assay (see Project 1) combined with additional evidence suggests that both cancer cell-cancer cell and cancer cell-stroma interactions are critically important for controlling the Proliferative-to-Aggressive phenotypic switch and the ensuing invasive cancer spread. Therefore, in Project 2, our goal is to identify and analyze novel targets as possible regulators of invasive cancer phenotype, particularly ones involved in cell-cell interactions. The key novelty in this project is in the realization that invasive cancer migration has many similarities with normal, invasive processes occurring in developmental or physiological processes, such as wound healing or development of the placental tissue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe will examine, in a species-dependent fashion, whether stromal cells exert differential resistance to or cooperation with the invasive cancer spread. A focus will be on the differential expression of specific chemo-attractants and chemo-repellents that are frequently associated with angigogenesis or neuronal migration. We will study the mechanisms regulating communication and putative interaction between cells adopting a more proliferative phenotype with cells adopting a more migratory phenotype. We will use novel techniques and approaches in Project 2 to perturb and validate possible novel targets as regulators of invasive cancer phenotype. Analysis of such targets will be conducted in collaboration with Project 1, since many of the techniques used in these projects are compatible and mutually enriching.'"

This will allow us to explore the progression of disease following genetic perturbation of molecules of interest identified in the RACE assay, for example, in the analysis of homo- and hetero-typic cell interactions. Viral libraries generated by Core 2 will be used to perform in vivo high throughput analysis, aimed at assaying multiple genetic perturbations, ultimately mimicking the RACE assay in vivo. Both animal models and virus libraries will be of immense utility to researchers both at Yale and elsewhere, representing a valuable resource within the Consortium.'"
Chicago Region Physical Science Oncology Center	Project	1	Ionic modulation of chromatin in cancer	"'[Project 1 summary](https://www.psoc.northwestern.edu/research/core-research-projects/project-1-ionic-modulation-of-chromatin-in-cancer/): Cellular potassium levels play a central role in regulating physiological processes and are maintained within narrow limits.  Recent studies reveal that aggressive and highly metastatic breast and multiple myeloma cancer cells maintain potassium concentrations that are several fold higher than matched non-tumorigenic cells. Since the strongest physiochemical interactions involved in reversible chromatin condensation are electrostatic, any perturbations in the ionic environment of the nucleus, such as those driven by a pathophysiological elevation of cellular K+ content, are anticipated to have profound effects on chromatin structure and access to transcriptional machinery.   Thus this discovery has global physiological implications.  It also has the potential to provide a mechanistic framework for a variety of reports showing that elevated potassium levels suppress cell death signaling pathways and may account for the large number of potassium channels that have been shown to play a role in cancer progression.  In this proposal we test the hypothesis that alterations in intracellular K+ and ionic strength alter chromatin structure and nuclear organization, and consequently global gene expression. These experiments will be performed across many length scales using Partial Wave Spectroscopy and STORM methods in the Nanocytometry Core: from intact living cells, to isolated nuclei and metaphase chromosomes and finally on nucleosome core particles.  To address our hypothesis we will develop new physical methods to: (a) understand the impact of potassium concentration on chromatin structure at the physical level in tumor cells; (b) probe the relationship between elevated potassium and clinical stage and grade of human tumors; and (c) probe whether this facet of cancer cell physiology can be exploited in the design of new combination chemotherapies. These advances in understanding ion imbalances in cancer may allow for the repurposing of current FDA-approved agents, such as diuretics that work by modulating intracellular potassium levels.  This project is central to the overarching framework of the CR-PSOC “Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Chromatin and Information Transfer in Cancer” because it addresses physical changes in the nuclear environment that are important in cancer progression.  In collaboration with the Project 3 team we will determine the extent of chromatin compaction in intact nuclei, and with the Project 2 team, we will test roles for potassium accumulation in leukemia.  The role of this Project in the Center is to resolve key electrostatic aspects of chromatin and its environment in the cancer cell nucleus. These new ideas and insights will be applied to understand and ultimately intervene in disease progression. This physical chemistry approach may lead to more effective therapeutic interventions using existing drugs.'"
Chicago Region Physical Science Oncology Center	Project	2	Molecular modulation of chromatin and nuclear structure in cancer	"'[Project 2 summary](https://www.psoc.northwestern.edu/research/core-research-projects/project-2-molecular-modulation-of-chromatin-and-nuclear-structure-in-cancer/): This project seeks to elucidate the role of enhancer dysfunction in modulating the spatio-temporal organization of chromatin and information transfer in cancer.  Genome sequencing efforts in recent years have revealed the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), such as loss of function mutations in EZH2 and TET2.  The effects of these mutations on chromatin structure and function are beginning to be elucidated.  Meanwhile with the advent of the ENCODE data and genome wide chromatin precipitation-sequencing studies it has become apparent that a large fraction of gene regulatory events are governed at enhancer sites located tens to hundreds of kilobases away from the start site of transcription.  Such sites are brought into apposition to gene promoters to stimulate gene expression through the formation of chromatin loops.  More recently, genomic surveys showed the presence of mutations in proteins linked to enhancer function, such as loss of function mutations of MLL3 (found within the common chromosome 7q36.1 deletion region in MDS and AML).  These enzymes encode histone methyltransferases that lead to the monomethylation of histone 3 lysine 4, a modification characteristic of enhancers.  p300, a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates these enhancers is mutated in MDS as well.  Mutation of TET2 in MDS signifies the importance of the hydroxymethylation modification, which our data indicate is present in enhancer sequences.  Finally the cohesin complex allows promoters and enhancers to loop together, facilitating gene expression.  Mutations in the genes of the cohesin assembly such as SMC3, STAG2, and RAD21 are found in MDS and AML. Collectively these data suggest that a subset of cases of AML and MDS suffers from enhancer dysfunction.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe hypothesize that enhancer dysfunction leads to an altered physical state of chromatin, including an abnormal state of 3-D looping, leading to aberrant formation of transcriptional, initiating and elongating complexes and destroying the normal regulation of gene expression in the cell.  This leads to the ineffective hematopoiesis and clonal expansion characteristic of MDS precursors.  We will use emerging CRISPR technology, advanced imaging (PWS/STORM microscopy) to visualize and monitor chromatin loop formation in response to oncogenic stimuli. We will use sophisticated chromatin confirmation capture and bioinformatics methods to create models of the physical state of chromatin in response to loss of key chromatin regulators.  Genome wide chromatin surveys will elucidate the aberrant structure and function of chromatin in hematologic malignancies.  Our work on the functional consequences of changes in chromatin structure at the kilobase-scale will interlock with an understanding of how ion concentrations alter chromatin structure and how folding mediated by condensins and cohesins affects chromatin structure and function at the megabase and chromosomal scale. We will use genetically edited cell models, genetically faithful animal models of AML and human specimens in xenografts to cross validate our work.  Finally we will determine if aberrant chromatin configurations lead to enhanced susceptibility to epigenetically targeted drugs.'"

Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics	Project	1	"Physical modeling and dynamics of tumor cell migration mechanics (David Odde, Ph.D., PI)"	"A key feature of highly aggressive cancers is their invasiveness, where transformed cells disseminate by crawling through the local micro-environment, ultimately causing death as the tumor invades and metastasizes. If these processes of cell motility could be suppressed, it would potentially extend lifespan and increase the potential effectiveness for local and global therapeutic treatments. However, we do not adequately understand the mechanical and chemical basis of cancer cell migration in complex and mechanically challenging microenvironments. The goal of this project is to develop and use a mathematical/computational model that will allow us to simulate cancer migration on a computer, and, in the longer-term, perform virtual in silico drug screening. Specifically, during this project we will mechanically parameterize glioblastoma (GBM) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumor cell migration so that patient outcomes can be predicted and new therapeutic strategies identified. Employing physical modeling for whole cell model migration, we have developed a “Cell Migration Simulator, v1.0,” (CMS1.0) to capture fundamental intracellular and extracellular mechanical processes regulating cell migration. Here, CMS1.0 will be used to 1) mechanically parameterize tumor heterogeneity, 2) bias immune-cancer cell interaction away from suppression and toward killing, and 3) elucidate proto-oncogene mechanism. Finally, we will also further develop the CMS1.0 to include more explicit F-actin dynamics, cell mechanics, and environmental fiber mechanics. In the process, we will build a physical sciences-based, patient-oriented approach toward understanding and controlling a key driver of cancer progression, cell migration. Thus, the project will establish the quantitative framework necessary to develop a model-driven approach to brain and pancreatic cancer invasion, so that therapies can be designed and engineered for better, more predictable outcomes."
Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics	Project	2	"Cell Migration in Mechanically Complex Microenvironments (Paolo Provenzano, Ph.D., PI)"	"Cancers are complex systems commonly associated with a robust fibroinflammatory stromal response, or desmoplastic reaction. This is highly relevant as it is now recognized that, in many solid tumors, the stromal compartment and its local microenvironments significantly influence disease progression. Through disease progression this desmoplastic reaction continues and often intensifies, offering critical support to malignant cells as they progress to invasive and often fully metastastic disease while also providing drug-free sanctuaries that limit access of small molecule therapies. Likewise, even the earliest stages of disease are associated with a robust immune reaction that evolves with disease progression. Here tumor microenvironments appear to form sanctuaries for immune evasion and in fact are comprised, in part, of infiltrated immune cells that have been subverted to act as active collaborators that enable tumor progression. Interestingly, while robust biochemical stimuli are present in tumors, they are not the only factor. These microenvironments also provide robust physical cues that conspire to promote disease progression. For instance, in solid tumors there are fundamental roles of extracellular matrix stiffness, composition and architecture that profoundly influence outcome. However, to date, the molecular and physical mechanisms by which matrix stiffness and architecture, and their relative contributions, influence tumor cell behavior are not well known. Here, we propose specific and integrated experiments and modeling to explicitly investigate the physical and molecular mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment regulates disease progression as a function of the underlying carcinoma genetics. Quantitative analysis and parameterization of data will facilitate model development and model predictions will be tested experimentally. Specifically, we will employ a series of 2D and 3D assays with varying stiffness and architecture of increasing complexity, and multiscale network modeling, to parse out the relative contributions of contact guidance cues and durotactic effects in complex microenvironments. Integration of chemical gradients will be used to parse out dominance, antagonism or synergy between chemical and physical cues. Further, we hypothesize that physical cues in the cellular microenvironment drive communication between different tumor cell populations and regulate immune cell infiltration and function. Thus, we seek to identify regimes where manipulating operant physical characteristics of a tumor reduces carcinoma cell advancement while simultaneously hampering immune evasion and promoting the antitumor response.'"

The core brings together expertise from two highly trained mouse and somatic cell geneticists, Dr. David Largaespada and Dr. Anindya Bagchi, both with expertise in modeling cancer in mice and with a wide array of cells. Thus, this core will generate two specific resources for both projects #1 and #2. The first is cohorts of mice that reliably develop pancreatic, glioma or medulloblastoma tumors due to the inheritance of germline transgenes, mutant alleles in their endogenous locus, or due to transposon-mediated gene delivery to the brain. Likewise, Core 2 will support studies perturbing the genetic events examined in each project. Additional models will be developed as needed. The models will be provided to project #1 and #2 scientists in age-matched cohorts and of both genders. Specifically, these will be models of glioma and medulloblastoma initiated in mice by transposon delivery of shRNA and cDNAs. A second resource is to provide genetically altered human cancer cell lines for project #1 and #2. These cell lines will harbor loss of function mutations, or specific single nucleotide variants (SNV), in genes of interest. They will be produced using TAL endonuclease or CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting, without or with oligonucleotide substrates, to create “knockout” cell lines due to imprecise non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in the former case, or SNVs via homology directed repair (HDR) in the latter case.'"

H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute	Project	1		"'Cancer is an open and complex adaptive system evolves at is grows. This evolution is driven by phenotypic/genomic plasticity in combination with highly selective microenvironments.  As cancers grow they can, in turn, alter the microenvironment and hence, can influence the trajectory of their own evolutionary dynamics.  These microenvironments occur in spatially distinct regions within tumors that can be characterized as distinct “habitats”, which can be identified by modern imaging at multiple scales.  The goal of Project 1 is to characterize the evolutionary dynamics using mathematical models informed by multi-scalar imaging and molecular analyses.  The choice of model systems is driven by those with high translational potential, in consultation with Project 2 and the Bench-to-Bedside Core.  We will focus our initial efforts on characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of prostate and breast cancers.  Specifically, both prostate and breast cancers can be effectively treated with anti-hormonal therapies, but in current clinical practice, these approaches inevitably select for resistance.  Forestalling the emergence of resistance using treatments based on evolutionary principles is a goal of the whole PSOC.  In support of current and planned clinical trials, we will generate in vitro and in vivo data from co-cultures of hormone-receptor positive and -negative cells grown in 3-D culture and in mouse xenografts, and use these data to inform models being developed within the B2B core.   In addition, we have identified distinct sub-types of cancer cells that co-exist within prostate cancers that are adapted to growth and survival under distinct microenvironmental conditions of pH and oxygenation.   Importantly, these sub-types have distinct prognostic characteristic, i.e. some are more indolent while others are aggressive and invasive.  We have observed in preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies that the evolutionary trajectory of some cancers can be altered towards a more benign phenotype by subtle microenvironmental perturbations.  Hence, we will continue to investigate these approaches in a broader array of animal models in vivo and 3-D culture system in vitro with the ultimate goal of developing math model-driven clinical trials using this approach.  A substantial effort will be expended to identify clinically achievable biomarkers to predict and monitor response to such approaches.  Finally, in recognition of the fact that the immune system plays a critical role in the establishment and therapeutic response of cancers, we will undertake the above studies in immune competent mouse models and investigate the evolutionary trajectory of immune system components during treatment of the animal patients, and these will be followed up with targeted in vitro studies with isolated immune cells.'"
H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute	Project	2		"'In the Moffitt PSOC, we view cancer as an open complex adaptive system that can be characterized using necessary and sufficient data, eco-evolutionary first principles and sophisticated computational methods. In Project 2, we examine the clinical application of that conceptual model. Here, we will build computational models of the system dynamics in individual cancer patients undergoing therapy with the ultimate goal of using those models to optimize the outcomes of increasingly complex cancer treatments   We will focus our initial efforts on three active clinical trials in different tumors (multiple myeloma, prostate cancer and glioblastoma) treated with three different therapeutic strategies (multidrug chemotherapy, hormonal treatment, and immunotherapy). In each trial a multidisciplinary team will develop a patient-specific computational model of the intratumoral evolutionary and ecological dynamics, based on available clinical data, which govern response and resistance to therapy in each patient. Using an iterative approach, each team will work with the Bench-to-Bedside (B2B) core and Project 1 to optimize the models’ predictive power by exploring alternative mathematical methods and inclusion of novel data elements from each trial (e.g. molecular analysis of primary tumors and circulating tumor cells). In follow-on trials using the same tumors and treatment strategies, we will both validate model predictions and apply variations in the treatment approaches (or combinations of approaches) suggested by pre-clinical experiments in Project 1 and model simulations in the B2B core.  Finally, we will develop the infrastructure necessary to develop and oversee evolutionarily-informed, computationally guided clinical trials at Moffitt.'"
H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute	Core	1	Bench-to-Bedside	"'The process of using mechanistic models to assist with understanding experimental results and informing clinical decisions depends on a suitable framework for developing, analyzing, implementing, adjusting and presenting the models and results. Furthermore, models must be calibrated so that they recapitulate experimental and clinical observations both in terms of their range of behavior as well as the intrinsic variability of outcomes before they can be used to specifically impact one or more clinical decisions (e.g. predict novel treatment strategies). There is also a practical aspect of turning theoretical predictions into actionable clinical decisions that requires tools to generate patient cohorts, mimic clinical trials and present results in a visual and easy to use manner such that clinicians can immediately understand and manipulate them. The central focus of the Bench-to-Bedside Core is therefore to integrate experiments, clinical data, and models to assist with hypothesis generation, testing, and validation (Project 1), and translate successes into a clinical setting using clinically-relevant tools (Project 2). This will be accomplished through: Core models that explore unifying principles of evolution, heterogeneity, and response to treatment; Core tools, Radiomics, Pathomics, and a generalized set of analysis tools for integrating experimental and clinical data to facilitate mathematical model development and calibration; Core decision support tools including Phase “i"" trials and dynamically optimized therapy for use in clinical trials.

For example, they will provide approaches to measure phospho-profiles of drug-sensitive pathways (e.g. EGFR), downstream signaling cascades (e.g. AKT and MAPK pathways), cell-cycle phases, and apoptotic response at the single cell level. Special emphasis is given to quantification of parameters for the dynamics of tumor cell proliferation and death (e.g. during drug treatment with varying concentration). This core contributes to the PS-OC by providing quantitative measurements that parameterize ""cellular fitness""(as a convolution of cell cycle and apoptosis dynamics) and signaling events in colorectal/gliomaneurospheres/leukemia lines of the relevant genotypes; these measurements are then inserted into the modeling framework of the PS-OC. To achieve these core\'s objectives (i.e. to establish a facility dedicated to providing quantitative measurements of cancer growth, signaling, and response to drugs in single-cell resolution for animal and cell line models of tumorigenesis), we 1) establish validated quantitative measurements of proliferation and death rates of primary tumors and associated molecular signatures; 2) provide single-cell resolution of the variability of cellular signaling response during varying conditions (such as exposure to growth factors, cytokines, drugs, radiation therapy etc); and 3) establish systematic protocols to test the drug response of primary tumor cells.'"

The Center for Immunotherapeutic Transport Oncophysics	Project	1	Transport of Effector T cells and Nano-DC vaccine in Breast Cancer	"'Co-Leader: Elizabeth A. Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D.\nCo-Leader: Rongfu Wang, Ph.D.\nCo-Leader: Haifa Shen, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that can process and present tumor antigen to T cells to initiate immune responses. Therefore, DC vaccines are a logical choice for therapeutic intervention. In order for a DC vaccine to elicit the proper immune responses, a sequence of physical and biological events must occur:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. the DC vaccine must migrate from the injection site to lymphoid tissues;\n2. the DC vaccine must maintain a mature stimulatory status to persistently process and present the immunizing antigen to T cells; and\n3. the antigen-specific T cells must travel to the tumor-bearing organ and infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment to exert their antitumor activity. These events are often insurmountable hurdles for most DC vaccines.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClinical studies have shown that less than 5% of intradermally injected DCs can reach the lymph nodes. The stimulatory signals of ex vivo-matured DCs cannot be maintained in vivo. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment prevents infiltration of the cytotoxic T cells. Overcoming these sequential barriers is critical for developing an effective DC vaccine. Accumulation of DC vaccines in the lymph nodes, especially tumor-draining lymph nodes, may depend on successful negotiation of the sequential physical and biological barriers. In addition, modification of the tumor microenvironment will potentially facilitate transport of effector T cells and drugs, which combined with our Nano-DC vaccine, would significantly improve cancer therapy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=Overview%2Dcircles%2Dv3%5F2%2D768x621%2Epng&align=None&scale=50&responsive=true}'"

MIT Mayo Physical Sciences Center for Drug Distribution and Drug Efficacy in Brain Tumors	Project	1	Modeling the Interface between Non-invasive Imaging and Drug Distribution	"'Dogma in clinical neuro-oncology holds that Gadolinium (Gd) contrast on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in tumor regions confirms that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is locally compromised, and thus sufficient levels of drug are being distributed within these tumor regions. However, drug distribution data indicate the importance of the local microenvironmental heterogeneity and other physical factors that lead to differential distribution of therapeutic agents relative to Gd contrast. Non-invasively acquired imaging features can provide a snapshot of tumor microenvironment and ultimately a better understanding of drug distribution. The goal of this project is to develop and validate a “minimal” model that will capture intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity to predict clinically relevant levels of drug distribution using routine imaging. In this project, we will use a combination of patient data, GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy imaging (MALDI-MSI), and stimulated raman spectroscopy (SRS) to quantify the differences in drug distribution within and across tumors and, in doing so, develop a computational framework for predicting the efficacy of BBB-penetrant and BBB-impenetrant drugs for the treatment of GBMs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur hypothesis is that mathematical models based on multiparametric high content imaging techniques will predict spatially distinct drug distribution patterns in invasive primary and metastatic brain tumor models for both small molecule and macromolecular therapeutics, and therefore be pivotal to predicting the in vivo efficacy of targeted therapies. In the first phase of the project we will build a computational framework that quantitatively connects imaging features with differences in drug distribution within and across tumors.  This part of the project involves experiments to quantify differences in drug distribution across tumors in a series of PDXs with MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), physical tissue features with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), development/calibration of imaging-driven models for drug distribution incorporating BBB permeability, and extending our results to patients through a Phase 0 trial. In the second phase of the project we will construct a computational framework that quantitatively connects differences in drug distribution with imageable response within and across tumors.  The second phase will include the investigatation of treatment response using BLI imaging, development/calibration of models of treatment response connecting drug distribution and tumor kinetics, and extension of our results to patients by determining sub-cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies. Overall, this project will provide a quantitative connection between imaging features and drug distribution at levels sufficient to predict heterogeneous treatment response across patients.

MIT Mayo Physical Sciences Center for Drug Distribution and Drug Efficacy in Brain Tumors	Project	2	"Defining the relationship between tumor composition, spatial heterogeneity, drug delivery, and drug efficacy"	"'Cancer genomic analysis enables the selection of therapeutic targets for precision medicine based on the detection of oncogenic events in a patient tumor. Despite significant advances in the field, there remains a daunting challenge in identifying optimal therapeutic agents that will be well distributed throughout the tumor and efficacious in their target inhibition. This challenge is exacerbated in brain tumors due to the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers (collectively referred to subsequently as the BBB) that can limit distribution into the central nervous system of otherwise highly effective therapies and likely contribute to the failure of many therapies targeting brain pathologies. The spatially heterogeneous distribution of targeted therapy throughout a patient tumor significantly impacts the molecular and cellular response. Local concentrations above a critical threshold can lead to target inhibition and cell death, but may also generate an adaptive response and activation of compensatory resistance pathways. At sub-threshold concentrations, our preliminary data indicate a paradoxical signaling network activation resulting in increased proliferation. For any given therapeutic agent and any given tumor, the tumor physical parameters and physico-chemical properties of the therapeutic agent that regulate drug distribution and efficacy are currently poorly understood.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDetermining the physical factors regulating therapeutic distribution and efficacy in vivo is a daunting challenge. Therapeutic distribution may be affected by its size, affinity, and molecular composition in combination with multiple physical factors of the tumor, such as vascular distribution and integrity along with spatial cellular and molecular heterogeneity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the first phase of this project, we will define the tumor tissue architecture and determine its effect on drug distribution.  Previous models, including those developed by the Wittrup lab, have focused on the effect of diffusion and distance from vasculature, to predict therapeutic delivery. While these models have worked well for many tumors, they are limited in predicting drug distribution into CNS tumors, due to the effect of the blood-brain barrier (intact in native vessels; aberrant in neovasculature), hypoxia, necrosis, edema, tumor growth kinetics, and the different dispersion behaviors of these tumors relative to non-CNS tumors. Using a variety of latest- generation bio-physical imaging and analytical techniques, combined with computational models provided by the Data Handling and Integration Core, we will generate improved computational models quantifying the physical properties of the tumor tissue architecture and their effect on drug distribution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the second phase of this project, we will quantify the adaptive molecular response to different therapeutic doses. To understand the overall tumor response to therapy it is necessary to quantify drug distribution and drug efficacy, including target inhibition and the systems-level signaling network-wide response to this inhibition. To quantify dynamic responses to different therapeutic concentrations for different durations, we propose to utilize cutting-edge systems biology analytical techniques, including next-gen RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry based proteomics and phosphoproteomics. To connect this data to cellular biology outcome, we will quantify tumor size, apoptosis, senescence, and proliferation under each condition. Multivariate data driven computational modeling in the Data Handling and Integration Core will identify the transcript and signaling nodes regulating cell response to therapy. Mechanistic pharmacodynamics modeling will then be used to predict the dynamic molecular and cellular response to spatially heterogeneous drug distribution. Models will be validated by IHC, PLA, and LCM-RNASeq to obtain spatially resolved response to therapy with approximately cellular resolution.'"

The Core will be led by Dr. Jann Sarkaria, who has extensive expertise in animal tumor models and by his long-time collaborator, Dr. William Elmquist, who is an expert in pharmacokinetic modeling of drug delivery into the brain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been developed to overcome the limitations of more traditional glioma models and have become one of the gold-standards for both basic and translational studies in GBM. The Sarkaria laboratory has developed a panel of 79 GBM xenografts that were established by implanting patient tumor specimens directly into the flank of nude mice. Maintenance of these xenograft lines by serial transplantation in mice preserves key genetic features of the corresponding patient tumor, such as EGFR amplification, and whole exome sequencing and RNAseq analysis demonstrates that these models are broadly representative of common molecular variants observed within GBM. We used a similar strategy to xenograft freshly resected brain tumor metastases to develop highly translational relevant models for brain metastases. To date, we have developed 38 brain metastasis PDX models, including 11 from melanoma metastases. These melanoma PDX models demonstrate robust intracranial growth when directly implanted into the brain, significant brain tropism following intracardiac injection, and similar to the glioma PDX models, we are completing our RNAseq analysis of these models.

Center on the Physics of Cancer Metabolism	Project	1	Effects of the Physical Microenvironment on Metabolism	"'Project Investigators: _Claudia Fischbach, Project Leader_,  Abe Stroock, Jeff Varner, Valerie Weaver, Andy Dannenberg\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and obesity lead to physical changes in the microenvironment, including aberrant multiscale structure and mechanics of the extracellular matrix, disturbed distributions of soluble factors, and population-level abnormalities in collective cell behavior. However, the functional interconnections between these physical variations and tumor metabolism remain unclear. This gap in understanding can be attributed to a lack of computational and experimental models that permit reliable prediction, recapitulation, and study of tumor and obesity-associated physical mechanisms in TNBC. By integrating biomaterials, tissue engineering, microfabrication, and computational models, Project 1 will investigate the hypothesis that physical changes in the microenvironment regulate malignancy by perturbing cellular metabolism. Furthermore, we will test whether obesity primes for tumorigenesis through similar mechanisms. To address these hypotheses, engineering-centric approaches will be integrated with transgenic mouse models, patient-derives xenografts, patient-derived organoid cultures, and drug testing. This approach will reveal novel mechanisms in tumor metabolic reprogramming for clinical translation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=Tumor%2Dspheroid1%2Dshtpe8%2Ejpg&align=None&scale=60&responsive=true}'"

Epithelial layer jamming in breast cancer cell migration	Project	1		"'If cancer cells did not migrate –and instead just stayed put– then cancer in most instances would be a more manageable disease. But cancer cells do migrate, and that migration accounts for much of cancer’s morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, we understand little about how, why, and when this aberrant cellular migration plays out. Cancer cells tend to migrate not as individual units but rather as a cellular collective –in multicellular strings, ducts, strands and clusters. We propose that a controlling factor in that collective cellular migration is a newly discovered phenomenon called “cell jamming”. From cars streaming in highway traffic to coffee beans flowing in a chute at the supermarket to cells migrating within a living tissue, a wide variety of collective systems –both inert and living– are now known to have the capacity to jam. Within a living cell cluster, in particular, cells can jam to become quiescent, solid-like, and virtually frozen in place, or instead can unjam to become mobilized, fluid-like, and migratory. In the physiological case of healthy tissues, we do not yet know if the transition from a jammed to an unjammed state is an essential part of organogenesis, pattern formation, and wound healing. And in the pathophysiological case of malignant tissues, neither do we know if the transition from a jammed to an unjammed state is a prerequisite for invasion or metastasis. We do know, however, that the discovery of cell jamming suggests a physical picture of collective cellular migration that is substantially richer than previously recognized, and we propose here to investigate cell jamming in the context of early stages of breast tumor progression. Breast cancer is representative of the wider class of cancers of epithelial origin –carcinomas– that account for the vast majority of cancers and cancer deaths.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo epithelial cells in some circumstances behave in one way –jammed, solid-like and aggregated with little possibility of mutual cell rearrangement, escape or invasion– while in other circumstances they behave in another –unjammed, fluid-like, disaggregated and invasive? We address this question in selected breast cancer cell lines, in a variety of extracellular environments that mimic native environments, and across graded stages of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Data derived from a comprehensive suite of novel experimental probes –cellular motions, traction stresses, intercellular stresses and cellular shapes (Figure)– will be critically examined through the lens of a novel quantitative theory of cell jamming. Specific questions include:   \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo cell populations that are jammed correspond to quiescent, lower risk states whereas populations that are unjammed correspond to states that are more motile, more invasive, or more likely to metastasize?\nConventional wisdom holds that adhesion molecules tether a cell to its immediate neighbors and thus tend to impede cellular migration. The theory of cell jamming and supporting preliminary data suggest the opposite interpretation –increased cell-cell adhesion facilitates cell unjamming and thereby promotes cellular migration. Is the conventional wisdom overly simplistic and perhaps even misleading?  Does the jamming hypothesis force a fundamental rethinking of the mechano-biology of cancer cell migration and metastasis?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow does the presence of stem-like features within cancer cell sub-populations alter the propensity for cell unjamming?\nImportantly, the cell jamming hypothesis makes predictions that are mechanistic, non-trivial, and counterintuitive. If supported by the data in the instances of the particular breast cancers to be addressed here, the hope is that the concept of cell jamming may improve understanding and guide novel therapeutic approaches –not only in those particular instances, but also more generally in other cancers of epithelial origin.\n\n&nbsp;\n![image](https://physics.cancer.gov/images/network/HarvardUniversity-slide1.jpg)'"
Quantitative analyses of tumor cell extravasation	Project	1		"'Understanding the fundamental mechanisms leading to metastatic cancer has been hampered by the need for models that replicate the in vivo situation, yet are amenable to tight control and facilitate high-resolution, time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of cell behavior. Over the past several years, we have developed microfluidic systems that are capable of simulating many steps of metastasis including tumor cell invasion, intravasation, trapping in the microcirculation or adhesion to the vessel walls, and extravasation into surrounding extracellular matrix. This prior work has shed new light on the interactions between a transmigrating tumor cell and the endothelium, the role of specific adhesion molecules, and the deformations of the cell and especially the cell nucleus, experience during the transmigration process. The object of our current study is to employ these assays in combination with new measurement methods to interrogate the changes in cell mechanics during the process of extravasation, and understand the nature of the cell-cell and cell-matrix force interactions. We are also investigating the nuclear deformations, changes in chromatin structure and the resulting changes in the transcriptome, which could have important implications for the subsequent ability of extravasated cells to form a new tumor. In close coordination with these experiments, computational models are being developed to simulate tumor cell / endothelial cell interactions, nuclear deformation, and the resulting changes in gene expression. We anticipate that these studies will provide new insights, and enhance our ability to identify and screen for new therapies to inhibit the tendency for metastatic spread of disease.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![https://physics.cancer.gov/images/network/MassachusettsInstituteofTechnology-slide1.jpg](https://physics.cancer.gov/images/network/MassachusettsInstituteofTechnology-slide1.jpg)\n\nA tumor cell (green) in the process of transmigrating across an endothelial monolayer (pink), as observed in a three-dimensional model of tumor cell extravasation.

ECM geometrical and mechanical properties modulate RTK signaling	Project	1		"'A serious problem with cancer treatment today is the tendency of cancer cells to develop resistance to the drugs we use to destroy them. The devastating result is that all too many cancer patients see their cancer at first respond positively to drug treatment, only to return later with a newfound resistance to the cancer drugs. A combination of discoveries from the Groves lab (physical chemistry, UCB) and the Weaver lab (cancer biology, UCSF) have lead to a new insight into how cancer cells acquire this resistance and how we might be able to stop this deadly process.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) somatic mutations and overexpression are found in many aggressive diseases such as non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. RTKs are thus important targets for cancer therapy. However, patients often develop resistance to RTK inhibitors, despite initially robust tumor regression. While this could be due to the emergence of mutated clones, stromal-epithelial interactions also regulate tumor progression and treatment response. In particular, there is a striking heterogeneity in extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanical properties in diseased tissue. Recent work from our groups suggests that ECM modulation of tumor behavior occurs through RTK signaling assemblies (Weaver et al., Cell, 2009; Nature, 2014; Cancer Res., 2014; Groves et al., Science, 2010), extending the mechanistic features of the mechano-signal initiation beyond the well-characterized effect of integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling. It is our thesis that in addition to genetic variation, external spatio-mechanical factors from the ECM are critical contributors to RTK therapy resistance. In this program, we will utilize the expertise of both of our groups to quantitatively characterize and manipulate the mechanical and topographical properties of the cellular microenvironment to understand the effects on RTK signaling (Figure), and its therapeutic inhibition. This study will provide actionable insights by pinpointing the molecular mechanisms by which ECM modulates RTK signaling and contributes to RTK inhibitor resistance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![https://physics.cancer.gov/images/network/UniversityofCaliforniaBerkeley-slide1.jpg](https://physics.cancer.gov/images/network/UniversityofCaliforniaBerkeley-slide1.jpg)\nFigure: Schematic of proposed research to study how the mechanical and topographical properties of the cellular microenvironment modulate RTK signaling and contribute to RTK inhibitor resistance in cancer treatment.'"
Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics	Project	1	Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics	"The University of Utah team is developing new mathematical frameworks to do what no others currently can, that is, create a single coherent model from multiple high-dimensional datasets, known as tensors. The frameworks – comparative spectral decompositions – generalize those that underlie the theoretical description of the physical world. The team is using the frameworks to compare and contrast datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, such as genomic profiles of multiple cell types from the same set of patients, measured more than once by several different methods. By using the complex structure of the datasets, rather than simplifying them as is commonly done, the frameworks enable the separation of patterns of DNA alterations – which occur only in the tumor genomes – from those that occur in the genomes of normal cells in the body, and from variations caused by experimental inconsistencies. The patterns that the team uncovers in the data are expected to offer answers to the open question of the relation between a tumor's genome and a patient's outcome.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor example, recent comparisons of the genomes of tumor and normal cells from the same sets of ovarian and, separately, glioblastoma brain cancer patients uncovered patterns of DNA copy-number alterations that were found to be correlated with a patient's survival and response to chemotherapy. For three decades prior, the best predictor of ovarian cancer survival was the tumor's stage; more than a quarter of ovarian tumors are resistant to the platinum-based chemotherapy, the first-line treatment, yet no diagnostic existed to distinguish resistant from sensitive tumors before the treatment. For five decades prior, the best prognostic indicator of glioblastoma was the patient's age at diagnosis. The ovarian and brain cancer data were published, but the patterns remained unknown until the team applied their comparative spectral decompositions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPending experimental revalidation, the team will bring the patterns that they uncover to the clinic, to be used in personalized diagnostic and prognostic pathology laboratory tests.

Among patients that were diagnosed at late stages, the DNA patterns distinguished short-term survivors, with a median survival time of three years, from long-term survivors, with a median survival time almost twice as long. Among patients treated with platinum, the DNA patterns distinguished those with platinum-resistant tumors, with a median survival time of three years, from those with platinum-sensitive tumors, with a median survival time of more than seven years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![http://www.alterlab.org/physics_of_cancer/jpgs/Image_3.jpg](http://www.alterlab.org/physics_of_cancer/jpgs/Image_3.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#####Patterns of DNA copy-number alterations in personalized diagnostic and prognostic tests.\nPending experimental revalidation, the team will bring the patterns that they uncover to the clinic, to be used in personalized diagnostic and prognostic pathology laboratory tests.

Physical Dynamics of Cancer Response to Chemotherapy in 3D Microenvironments	Project	1		"'Our project aims to develop a new computationally driven platform to examine complex physical and chemical microenvironments utilizing organ-on-chip microfluidic bioreactor technology coupled with a predictive mathematical model of tumor growth and therapeutic response.  Malignant breast tumors are highly heterogeneous in terms of their cellular composition, varying levels of oxygenation, acidity, and nutrients, as well as local changes in the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, tumor tissue and tumor microenvironment properties can dynamically evolve not only during tumor growth but also when anticancer treatments are administered.  Despite this, nearly all pre-clinical assessments of drug efficacy and optimal dosing are performed using homogeneous 2D cell cultures that do not resemble the cellular, metabolic, and physical features manifest in tumors in vivo. Such approach suffered from overly reductionist ex vivo/in vitro and studies may not fully recapitulate the complexity of cancers, especially their physical and chemical microenvironments. To address these issues, we concentrate on developing an integrated quantitative platform that combines the power of organ-on-chip 3D tissue bioreactor, developed to include non-uniform fully controlled physical and chemical microenvironments, together with a 3DMultiCell math model that allows predictive testing of a broad range of microenvironmental combinations around the experimentally validated baseline.\n\n#### Goals:\n\n1.

Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution)	Project	1	Dynamic genomic and microenvironmental models of chemoresistance	"'PIs: Bild, Adler, Sharma; co-Is: Werner, Bowtell\nBreast and ovarian cancers are heterogeneous diseases, as a typical tumor contains multiple “subclones”, which are defined as evolutionarily related subpopulations of cells with a different complement of somatically acquired DNA mutations and phenotypes. When chemotherapeutic agents are administered to the patient, some of these subclones may gain a selective advantage and develop resistance to the treatment, resulting in cancer relapse and progression. For this reason, it is imperative to identify these subclones and their evolution across treatment; and to understand how the genomic aberrations within these subclones drive resistance to chemotherapy. We will integrate experimental biology and computational models across temporal samples of patient tumors as they develop a resistant state in order to better understand and combat refractory and terminal cancer. To enable the study of tumor heterogeneity evolution in patients, we will utilize a highly unique collection of metastatic tumor cells from breast and ovarian cancer patients before, during, and after treatments, often across multiple courses of chemotherapy, as well as tumors from a clinical trial taken before and after therapy. We use deep sequencing to find genomic aberrations at each of these time points, and develop systems models to identify the subclones and follow phenotypic changes and their functional impacts of subclone evolution in response to chemotherapy. We hypothesize that 1) Dynamical systems models based on the evolution of subclone structure and acquisition of oncogenic phenotypes during treatment can identify key factors in the development of a chemo-resistant state; and 2) We can delay development of a chemo-resistant cancer state by inhibiting development of phenotypes that emerge over time commonly during treatment. We will model resistant cancer cell populations and both extrinsic and immune microenvironmental factors to identify critical features of acquired resistance and apply these models to a clinical trial aimed at blocking transition to a resistant cancer state. While these components can exhibit co-dependencies, by their nature they can also have vulnerabilities based on these interactive features, and if one can inhibit dependent relationships within a population it may be possible to shift the equilibrium of a tumor from a chemoresistant state to a sensitive state. The algorithms and procedures we are developing in this proposal will for a rational basis for real-time patient monitoring and making treatment choices for refractory patients. The outcomes of this research will deliver approaches to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage breast and ovarian cancer patients.'"
Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution)	Project	2	Targeting cooperative phenotypes common in spatial heterogeneity	"'PIs: Chang, Cohen; co-I: Bowtell\nRecent studies in primary tumors have found a remarkable degree of intratumor heterogeneity, where a single tumor is comprised of a range of subclones exhibiting a diversity of phenotypes, including molecular profiles, proliferation capacity, and response to therapies. Although heterogeneity is now widely reported, few studies have investigated the heterogeneity of metastatic tumors at the end stage, despite the fact that metastatic cancer is estimated to be responsible for over 90% of cancer deaths. For breast and ovarian cancer, tumors that progress to metastasis are refractory to treatment. Therefore, there is a great need to determine the mechanisms by which subclonal diversity can affect the metastatic phenotype and underlie the difficulties in treatment. Studying metastatic tumors is difficult due to the challenges in collecting patient tissues. While primary tissues are typically obtained through biopsy, this is rarely performed for metastatic sites. To address this difficulty, we have developed both a rapid autopsy strategy where we collect fresh samples of metastatic tumors within hours of patient death, as well as collections of metastatic tumor biopsies in the clinical trial setting prior to and after drug treatment. These collections enable us to profile multiple metastatic sites and investigate the association between metastatic sites and subclonal evolution in an isogenic background. We propose to leverage this unique data set to investigate the relationship between evolution of tumor subclones during metastatic progression and the phenotypic profiles of these tumors. We hypothesize that, despite the diversity in their genetic mutation profiles, metastatic tumors exhibit clonal dynamics that ultimately leads to convergence on more common cooperative phenotypic networks, and that targeting the key dependencies within this network will lead to increased collapse of the metastatic tumor population. To investigate this, we will profile the tumors by whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and single cell RNA sequencing. This data, coupled with our newly developed algorithms for dissecting subclonal populations using tree reconstruction algorithms, for eliciting phenotypes from gene expression profiles using Bayesian statistics, and for simulating phenotypic evolution using mathematical models from ecology; will enable us to understand (Aim 1) the subclonal heterogeneity that underlies metastatic initiation and progression; (Aim 2) how cooperative functions evolve to a chemo-refractory signaling network, and therapeutic strategies to target it; and (Aim 3) how these dynamics are manifested human tumors in a clinical trial. Our investigations represent the first characterization of the clonal dynamics of a large multisite metastatic cohort, and will provide a new framework for understanding and treating end-stage tumors based on the evolution of cooperative phenotypes. We will develop these models on patient samples and test them in a unique clinical trial, ensuring the physiological, if not clinical, relevance of our findings.'"

Embryonal Brain Tumor Networks	Project	1		"'Our U01 is an innovative, systems biology approach designed to uncover new therapeutic strategies for childhood embryonal tumors. These tumors are the most common central nervous system malignancies in childhood, and there is a pressing need for better therapies. Current survival rates range from 30 – 80% depending on subgroup, and nearly all survivors have impaired neurological and neurocognitive function. Extensive genomic analysis of medulloblastomas, the most common embryonal tumors, failed to identify “driver genes” that could explain the origin of most tumors or suggest new strategies. Nevertheless, these tumors can be grouped into a small number of subtypes that share transcriptional patterns and clinical outcomes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe believe that it is time for a fundamentally new approach that seeks oncogenic “driver pathways” rather than “driver genes.” As many different genomic changes can all affect the same driver pathway, such pathways cannot be uncovered by looking for recurring genomic changes alone. Rather, we use a systems biology approach based on a wide variety of omic methods to identify these oncogenic driver pathways.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are creating comprehensive, genome-wide datasets from human medulloblastoma tumors and cell lines by measuring mutations, copy number variations, mRNA expression, proteomic (including enrichment for several types of post-translational modifications), metabolomic, and epigenomic data. We have developed innovative network models methods to unite these diverse data and thereby identify shared pathways altered across many patients within a subtype. Finally, we will test driver pathways nominated from the network modeling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy merging these diverse data collected from tumors of individual patients, we will have an unprecedented ability to uncover the root causes of cancer, providing new therapeutic strategies.

Both projects will require access to patient samples and cells derived from PDX and organoid models. The core supports 3 functions: (1) cryopreservation and distribution of primary cells from patients with leukemia, colon, and pancreatic cancer, (2) establishment, characterization, and distribution of xenograft, organoid, and cell culture models of these diseases, and (3) isolation of cell populations from primary tumor samples and tissue models for single cell analysis. The functions of the core include documentation and tracking of informed consent, isolation and cryopreservation of viable tissue, plasma or serum, and genomic DNA from patient samples and distribution of samples to CSBC investigators. A large number of primary leukemia, colon and pancreatic tumor samples are currently available in our existing repositories for use by Project Investigators. Additional samples will be acquired from patients routinely evaluated in our gastrointestinal oncologic and hematologic malignancies clinics. In addition to distributing primary cells to program investigators, Core 1 will also maintain and distribute a bank of well characterized PDXs selected for passage in immunocompromised mice. Methods for engrafting leukemia cells and primary epithelial tumor tissues in immunodeficient mice are now well established, and we and others have successfully used PDX models for drug testing.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity (M2CH)"	Project	1	Therapeutic Management of Lineage- and Differentiation-state Plasticity	"'######PIs: Sears, Demir; co-Is: Tomlin, Margolin, Adey, Langer\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHeterogeneity in differentiation state in a TNBC tumor and cell line demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining for differentiation-associated proteins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTNBC is an aggressive disease characterized by high intratumor heterogeneity and poor patient outcome. In preliminary experiments, we identified subpopulations of tumor cells in primary TNBC as well as in basal-like TNBC cell lines that are characterized by differential expression of luminal, basal, and mesenchymal differentiation-state markers. We have observed that distinct classes of targeted therapeutics have the capacity to eliminate or enrich specific differentiation-state subpopulations within these lines, steering heterogeneous cancer cell populations toward increased homogeneity. Importantly, we identified synergistic combinatorial treatments that targeted either pathway dependencies predicted by master regulator analysis of residual cells or epigenetic regulators found to contribute to a cell’s transition to a resistant state. The overall goal of this project, therefore, is to understand cell intrinsic regulation of therapeutic response in phenotypically heterogeneous TNBC in order to develop targeting strategies to kill all co-existing subpopulations. We focus on phenotypic heterogeneity, as this can represent the combination of genetic and epigenetic factors, and we take advantage of clinically relevant therapeutics that drive heterogeneous populations toward homogeneity. We hypothesize that a systems biology approach of measuring and computationally modeling the functional pathways underlying phenotypic state changes in response to state-aggregating therapeutics will reveal common escape routes and regulators of cell plasticity, which allow us to predict effective combinatorial therapeutic strategies that eliminate all cancer subpopulations. We address this hypothesis by (1) examining and computationally modeling phenotype state changes in multiple genetically diverse, heterogeneous TNBC cell lines in response to targeted therapeutics that induce homogeneity using high-content imaging and single cell expression analysis, (2) determining whether clonal expansion or differentiation state plasticity drives the dynamic phenotype changes following targeted therapy and modeling the molecular network changes that underlie these transitions, and (3) determining epigenetic regulation underlying state transitions and developing combinatorial strategies that overcome therapeutic resistance in heterogeneous TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Together, these aims support our goal to measure and model cell intrinsic responses to clinically relevant targeted therapeutics and to predict synergistic drug combinations that more effectively control heterogeneous TNBC. Integration of this work with Projects 2 and 3 allows us to incorporate extrinsic regulators of these intrinsic mechanisms and to iteratively refine control strategies for this devastating disease.'"
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity (M2CH)"	Project	2	Managing Microenvironment-mediated Heterogeneity and Resistance	"'######PIs: Heiser, Korkola; co-Is: Margolin, Demir\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSchematic illustration of the process used to use microenvironment microarrays to interrogate the effects of microenvironmental proteins on therapeutic responses. The inability to effectively treat TNBC is thought to be in part due to its heterogeneity, as cells are highly plastic and able to respond rapidly to therapeutic insults to steer into drug resistant states. One aspect that is likely to strongly influence TNBC plasticity, heterogeneity, and response to therapy is the microenvironment (ME) in which cells reside. Interactions with extracellular matrix proteins or soluble factors like growth factors and cytokines can profoundly change phenotypic properties of TNBC cells, and mounting evidence suggests that such ME factors also influence response to therapy. We hypothesize that the ME impacts therapeutic response of TNBC, and that consideration of signals from the ME in treatment decisions are likely to lead to improved therapeutic control and patient outcomes. We couple experimental assessment of TNBC response to targeted therapeutics in the presence of defined combinatorial ME perturbations (MEPs) with concomitant expression profiling and computational approaches to define underlying pathway signatures to identify vulnerabilities in residual cancer cells that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit. This is accomplished using microenvironment microarrays to identify MEPs that confer resistance to six targeted therapeutics in TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples. We perform expression profiling by RNA-Seq at fixed time points on TNBC cells grown in the presence of resistance conferring MEPs plus therapeutic and use computational approaches to identify underlying reduced dimensionality network signatures (PREdictors of CEllular Phenotypes to guide Therapeutic Strategies, PRECEPTS) that are altered as a result of interactions of cells with MEP and drug. These altered PRECEPTS signatures represent candidates for therapeutic intervention, and are tested using drug combinations in an attempt to overcome ME-mediated resistance. We perform dynamic imaging and expression profiling of the response of TNBC cells to resistance conferring MEPs plus drug and identify PRECEPTS signatures that are dynamically altered. Such PRECEPTS signatures represent potential transition vulnerabilities that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention, which we test experimentally using drug combination treatments of TNBC cells. These approaches are closely coordinated with those of Projects 1 and 3 in the use of common cell lines, drugs, and reagents and to maximize the information that we derive from the experiments. This approach enables the discovery of new drug combinations that could be deployed clinically to improve outcome in TNBC patients with primary and disseminated disease.'"
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity (M2CH)"	Project	3	Understanding the Impact of Microscale and Nanoscale Heterogeneity and Resistance	"'######PIs: Gray, Tomlin; co-Is: Nan, Margolin, Chang\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIntegration of omic and spatial features to identify molecular networks that control molecular heterogeneity. We use a spatial systems approach to identify molecular networks that control development of resistance-associated heterogeneity in TNBCs and to use this information to devise multidrug treatments that are effective in heterogeneous TNBCs. Our focus is on heterogeneity that arises from epigenomic plasticity intrinsic to cancer cells and from extrinsic signals from the diverse microenvironments into which TNBC cells disperse. Individual cells within a TNBC exhibit variable phenotypes and respond variably to treatment so that establishing durable control of TNBCs is notoriously difficult. We explore the mechanisms by which individual cells in TNBC tissues respond to perturbations induced by microenvironment interactions and/or drugs. Our approach is based on the concept that the phenotype and response to therapy of every cell in a heterogeneous TNBC tissue is influenced by its intrinsic epigenomic status and by the microenvironmental signals it receives. In short, every cancer cell-microenvironment-drug interaction in a heterogeneous experimental tissue or clinical specimen is an independent experiment of nature. We analyze ensembles of such interactions in TNBC tissues before and after treatment to determine the impact of local environmental signals on cancer cell phenotype and therapeutic response. We accomplish this using cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence to stain cancer cells for quantitative analysis of proliferative status, differentiation state, and expression levels of proteins that report on control network activity. We quantify cancer cell-microenvironment interactions at the microscale using multicolor fluorescence microscopy and at the nanoscale using multispectral super resolution fluorescence microscopy and 3D scanning electron microscopy. We use custom image analysis techniques developed in the Imaging Core to quantify cell and microenvironment components and machine/deep learning strategies to identify microenvironment-cancer cell interactions that influence phenotype. This work guides development of dynamic models of spatially dependent control network-microenvironment interactions that can be used to devise therapeutic strategies to control TNBCs. The approach is statistically powerful since every tissue section contains details about tens of thousands of cell-microenvironment interactions. We accomplish this by; (1) developing cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence, multiscale image analysis, and machine learning procedures needed to identify molecular control networks in individual cells in TNBC tissues that respond to signals from microenvironmental cells and proteins (MEPs) and that influence phenotype and/or therapeutic response, (2) elucidating the effects of microenvironmental cells and high impact proteins on TNBC control network activity, phenotype, and therapeutic response in bioprinted tissues. (3) assessing the effects of microenvironmental cells and high impact proteins on TNBC control network activity, phenotype, and therapeutic response in TNBC xenografts and clinical TNBC specimens.'"

Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression	Project	1	High-order assembly of MegaTrans complexes for hormone-independent enhancer activation	"'Endocrine therapy is commonly used in hormone-driven breast and prostate cancers. A persistent challenge is disease progression caused by hormone resistance during the treatment. Studies for the past 25 years have revealed an essential role of hormones (i.e., estrogen and androgen) and their receptors, ERα and AR, in cancer progression. Increased evidence indicates that epigenetic deregulation of ERα/AR-bound enhancers profoundly alters hormone-mediated transcription machineries, leading to the development of hormone resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this hormone-resistance transition of enhancer function are largely unknown. We have recently discovered that the most active and functionally important ERα-bound enhancers can recruit a large number of DNA-binding transcription factors through protein-protein interactions. These newly identified ERα ‘co-activators’, termed MegaTrans transcription factors (TFs), are required to activate ERα-bound enhancers and also serve as a signature of functional enhancers. Our preliminary data additionally show the presence of MegaTrans TFs in AR-bound enhancers. Because most MegaTrans TFs are signaling-dependent molecules, they may receive other signals from tumor microenvironments to alter enhancer functions. Thus, combinatorial interactions between ERα/AR and MegaTrans TFs make their enhancers respond not only to estrogen or androgen, but also to other microenvironmental signals. The composition and interaction of MegaTrans TFs undergo dynamic changes during cancer progression, resulting in alterations of ERα/AR enhancer functions that promote hormone-resistance in breast and prostate cancer cells.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=u54%5Futhscsa%5Fosu%5Fimage2%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true}\nCis- and trans-binding transcription factor'"
Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression	Project	2	Fine-scale nucleosome repositioning of enhancers for hormone-independent genomic function	"'The cognate receptors AR and ERα can remain active for tumor progression after anti-hormone treatment for patients with prostate and breast cancers. Despite intensive efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, little information is available concerning AR/ERα genomic function for promoting hormone resistance at the nucleosome level. In recent studies, we observed this genomic function is well orchestrated, relying on precise nucleosome organization within cis-bound enhancers for hormone-dependent transcription. Interestingly, we also found that this epigenetic mechanism can be hijacked by hormone-resistant cells to gain their growth and invasion advantages. Therefore, we hypothesize that altered nucleosome positions, or nucleosome repositioning, in and near AR/ERα-bound enhancers is being exploited for hormone-independent genomic function in advanced cancers. In Aim 1, we will conduct ChIP-ePENS and MNase-seq to comprehensively map nucleosome boundaries of AR/ERα-bound enhancers in a panel of hormone-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells. RNA-seq will be conducted to determine differential expression patterns of corresponding genes in these cell lines. The NucPat computational pipeline will be deployed to seamlessly process complex omics-seq data (Aim 2). We will use a Kernel Density Estimation algorithm to determine nucleosome positioning and spacing when AR or ERα establishes direct contact with its binding motif. Using a Hidden Markov model, we will identify active nucleosome states that maximize DNA-protein contact for AR/ERα genomic functions. In addition, pioneer factor FOXA1 and chromatin remodelers participate in this nucleosome repositioning even in the absence of agonists or in the presence of antagonists. To confirm this computational modeling in vivo, ChIP-ePENS and MNase-seq will be conducted in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines carrying hormone-sensitive and -resistant tumors (Aim 3). A nucleosome-phasing index (NPI) will be established to quantitatively assess the nucleosome states of AR/ERα redeployment in different PDX lines. This integrative omics analysis will be extended to a cohort of primary tumors, categorized into high- and low-risk groups. Again, we will calculate individual NPIs and correlate the data with clinicopathological features of patients. This translational study is intended to determine whether nucleosome phasing for AR/ERα redeployment is already present in high-risk primary tumors. Patients with this intrinsic phenotype are expected to have an adverse clinical outcome, irrespective of their anti-hormone treatments. Therefore, our study will address a previously uncharacterized mechanism of hormone resistance and provide experimental evidence that nucleosome repositioning plays an integral role in redefining AR/ERα genomic function for advanced development of prostate and breast cancers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=u54%5Futhscsa%5Fosu%5Fimage3%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true}\nPre-existing nucleosome phasing (N2) promotes androgen-independent AR transcription in cancer cells treated with antagonist ENZ, compared to those stimulated with agonist DHT'"
Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression	Project	3	Topological mapping of chromatin architectures for hormone-independent gene transcription	"'Long-range chromatin interactions between ERα/AR-bound enhancers and promoters are necessary for coordinated gene regulation in breast and prostate cancer cells. These interactions occur via the formation of 3D chromatin architecture that brings enhancers and transcription factor complexes into close contact with target genes. To decode this complex regulation, we and other investigators have previously used Hi-C to map topologically associated domains (TADs) in different cell types. In a further study, we have identified a cancer-specific TAD on chromosome 17q23 that can be partitioned into an ERα-regulated transcription hub. Concordant up-regulation of its target genes is found to be associated with short disease-free survival in a subgroup of ERα-positive breast cancer patients, irrespective of their anti-hormone treatments. Emerging evidence has also shown AR-specific TADs are present in the prostate cancer cell genome. Therefore, we hypothesize that 1) frequent hormone (i.e., estrogen or androgen) stimulation leads to the formation of ERα/AR-related TADs that dynamically regulate transcription of multiple genes for aberrant proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells and 2) in the presence of antagonists, a subset of these chromatin domains, herein termed transition TADs, continue to be exploited through chromatin redeployment for hormone-independent transcription. Whereas the majority of ERα/AR-related TADs are functionally suppressed by antagonists, transition TADs may partially escape this blockade for constitutive regulation of gene transcription. To test these hypotheses, we will use a modified Hi-C method, called tethered conformation capture (TCC), to investigate dynamic changes of TAD structures in hormone-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines exposed to agonists or antagonists (Aim 1). ChIP-seq of repressive, active, and gene-body histone marks and CTCF insulator will also be conducted in this cell line panel. MNase-seq and MBDCap-seq datasets will be acquired to map euchromatinized and heterochromatinized TADs. To integrate omics-seq data, we will develop a computational model, PRAM3D, which applies a Poisson Random effect Architecture Model (PRAM) to recapitulate 3D chromatin architectures (Aim 2). A Bayesian hierarchical model will predict putative transition TADs that concordantly regulate hormone-independent transcription of target genes. Furthermore, we will use a nucleosome density method to classify transition TAD subdomains into different regulatory categories, i.e., active, repressive, or bivalent transcription hubs. CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing of critical chromatin regions may functionally disassemble spatiotemporal organization of these TAD-associated hubs (Aim 3). Proliferation and invasion/migration assays will determine whether this genome editing partially re-sensitizes cancer cells to anti-hormone treatments. We will also interrogate mechanistic contribution of histone modifications and other epigenetic modulators for the establishment of transition TAD structures. In silico expression profiling and single-cell RNA seq will be conducted in primary tumors of TCGA cohorts and in cancer cell subpopulations, respectively, and determine whether concordant regulation of TAD-associated target genes is intrinsic predictors of hormone resistance in breast or prostate cancer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=u54%5Futhscsa%5Fosu%5Fimage4%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true}\nERα-mediated transcription of a TAD located on 17q23 in breast cancer cell'"

Phenotype Transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer	Project	1		"'The goal of our U01 project to develop rational systems approaches to treat cancer. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is arguably the most aggressive form of lung cancer, and while modern treatment strategies are initially highly effective, tumors quickly relapse, resistant to further therapies.

Our major driving questions are: How does SCLC heterogeneity contribute dynamic adaptation to treatment? What regulatory mechanisms govern this response, and how are they coordinated? How can these regulatory mechanisms be manipulated to drive SCLC cells toward therapeutically desirable phenotypes? What molecular species can be targeted therapeutically to affect these mechanisms? To this end we will integrate bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, and experimentation to provide a systems-level understanding of SCLC drug response and optimal treatment strategies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n####Our project is articulated into two Aims:\n\n#####Aim 1 – Identify key transcriptional regulators of phenotypic transitions and drug-sensitivity in neuroendocrine (NE), mesenchymal-like (ML), and hybrid SCLC phenotypes.\n\nThe goal of this Aim is to reverse-engineer the regulatory circuits underlying SCLC heterogeneity and drug response, and develop intervention strategies to control the circuit’s dynamics. TFs induce and maintain cell identity and can be used to reprogram cells by activation and/or inhibition of small groups of TFs (such as in induced pluripotent stem cells). In previous work (Udyavar et al, 2016), we showed that canonical neuroendocrine/epithelial (NE) and mesenchymal-like (ML) SCLC phenotypes correspond to attractors (stable states, as in the bottoms of energy wells) of a core TF regulatory network, as well as identifying novel “Hybrid” single-cell phenotypes (Figure 1). Here, we will expand our TF network to describe these hybrid phenotypes, and integrate data from multiple sources including human tumors and tissue microarrays (TMAs). Based on publically available transcriptomic datasets and TMAs, we employ bioinformatic techniques including Consensus Clustering, WGCNA, ARACNe, and Gabi (manuscript in preparation), as well as database mining, to identify molecular processes characterizing heterogeneous SCLC phenotypes, and uncover networks for TFs which regulate expression of those processes. Single-cell experiments are used to validate the phenotypic character of individual SCLC cells.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=u10%5Fvanderbilt%5Fpic1%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true}\nFigure 1. The hypothesized SCLC heterogeneity landscape comprised of multiple phenotypic states (distinguished by color) grouped in attractor basins. Arrows indicate phenotype transitions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBoolean simulations of this TF network will reveal underlying regulatory mechanisms which stabilize single-cell heterogeneous SCLC phenotypes, and provide an in silico representaiton which we will explore to find cocktails transcription factors which reprogram cells from untreatable attractors into treatable ones. This is a computationally expensive task which must take into account uncertainty in the network topology, TF regulatory interaction rules, and stochastic effects in order to prioritize the most likely candidate reprogramming targets. We have therefore developed GPU/CPU hybrid algorithms to address this need and run the simulations in high-performance computing environments.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final outcome of this Aim will be a mechanistic model that describes the regulation of NE, ML, and hybrid phenotypes based on TF gene regulatory dynamics, that will guide further exploration and experimental validation.\n\n#####Aim 2 – Identify signaling perturbations that promote SCLC shifting to phenotypes maximally susceptible to killing under drug treatment.\n\nWhile Aim 1 seeks to uncover underlying regulatory mechanisms of SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity and drug response, it is well-known that TFs are difficult, and often impossible, to target directly in the clinic. Here we exploit the fact that intracellular signaling pathways, which are commonly targeted in the clinic, can be used to indirectly manipulate the activity of TF networks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n${image?fileName=u10%5Fvanderbilt%5Fpic2%2Epng&align=None&scale=100&responsive=true}\nTable 1. Biological features in the SCLC modules identified by WGCNA, which distinguish NE, ML, and hybrid states.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo attain this goal, we will first identify and experimentally validate signaling pathways which are heterogeneously active across distinct SCLC phenotypes. Heterogeneous WGCNA gene co-expression modules are found which are enriched for expression of distinct signaling pathways (Table 1). CyTOF will be used to validate the activity of these at the single-cell level, providing a high resolution map of SCLC signaling pathway activity. Using this map, we will track the single-cell response of SCLC cells to drug treatment. Our group has developed a metric of drug sensitivity based on the net Drug Induced Proliferation rate (DIP rate), which we will use to estimate the effects of selection for distinct phenotypes. Coupled with this, we have implemented a Stochastic Phenotype Transition Proliferation (SPTP) model to quantify relative roles of selection and plasticity, by tracking single-cell drug response population shifts. We will complement this with unsupervised and semi-supervised logistic regression algorithms to link molecular drivers to cellular drug response. This information, will enable us to prioritize optimal combinations of chemotherapy, paired with signaling perturbations which drive cells toward states sensitive to that specific chemo-agent. These combinations will be tested in vitro, and the best candidates will be validated in in vivo mouse models.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith the completion of this Aim, we will have developed of a map of SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity, coupled with signaling-induced transition paths and chemo-agent sensitivity. This map will provide clinically actionable signaling drivers which can push SCLC cells toward states which maximize chemotherapy efficacy.'"

The Cancer Cell Map Initiative	Project	1	Systematic Identification of Driver Networks in Cancer	"'######Project Leaders: Krogan and van ‘t Veer\n######Co-Investigators: Agard, Ashworth, Ideker, Grandis and Gutkind\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA vast number of mutations contribute to cancer, but the observed non-random combinations of those leading to transformation highlight the importance of hallmark pathways and networks in cancer progression. While many pathways have been implicated in cancer, attributes such as tumor heterogeneity, tissue of origin, and degree of progression lead to each case exhibiting a unique subset of altered pathways. Taken together, this diversity among cancer types and their origins has complicated the development of targeted cancer treatments. We propose to systematically identify the protein networks driving cancer, across a range of tumor types starting with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. Coupled with functional validation and high-resolution structural analysis of the key protein interactions and complexes, we anticipate major insights into the underlying tumor biology as well as the potential to unravel genetic vulnerabilities of therapeutic relevance.'"
The Cancer Cell Map Initiative	Project	2	Mapping the Pharmacogenetic Landscape for Precision Medicine	"'######Project Leaders: Ashworth and Mali\n######Co-Investigators: Esserman, Grandis, Gutkind, Ideker, Krogan, Mesirov and van ‘t Veer\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is well known that cancer is tremendously heterogeneous with few tumors having the same set of mutated, amplified, or deleted genes. Clearly these molecular differences alter a tumor’s responsiveness to chemotherapy, but current knowledge of how the tumor genotype influences drug sensitivity is poor. We will seek to vastly increase our understanding of pharmacogenetic interactions in cancer (gene-gene and gene-drug interactions). Recognizing that oncogenic transformation requires alteration of the function of many genes, we will use state-of-the-art high-throughput epistasis mapping and data analysis pipelines to systematically interrogate the function and pairwise interactions of a panel cancer driver genes and therapeutic targets in both head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, expecting to identify many new synthetic lethal relationships. Anticipating the discovery of multiple therapeutically relevant synthetic lethal interactions, we have already formulated a plan for rapid clinical testing of the most promising hits as new treatment arms on the I-SPY 2 trial in breast cancer. Through this work, we expect to develop fundamental new insights into the genetic logic and functional synergies underlying cancer pathways as well as to greatly expand the ability of clinicians to practice precision oncology.'"
The Cancer Cell Map Initiative	Project	3	Using Networks to Seed Hierarchical Whole-Cell Models of Cancer	"'######Project Leaders: Ideker and Mesirov\n######Co-Investigators: Esserman, Grandis, Gutkind and van ‘t Veer\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKnowledge of cell biology is often modeled in the form of molecular networks and interaction maps, consisting of sets of genes and gene-gene (or protein-protein) pairwise interactions. In reality, however, biological systems are not simply one large protein network, but consist of a deep and dynamic hierarchy of functional subsystems ranging across many orders of magnitude in scale. Here, we move beyond basic interaction maps to instead use molecular interaction data to develop hierarchical structure/function models of the cancer cell. This hierarchical structure will be developed using the protein-protein interaction data generated here and backstopped by public networks; it will provide an objective definition of a cancer cell by systematically identifying the hierarchical relations among its associated systems of genes and proteins. We will next use this descriptive hierarchy to seed a predictive whole-cell model of cancer. This hierarchical model will be validated and revised by applying it to predict therapeutic responses in PDXs of head and neck and breast tumors as well as inform an ongoing I-SPY 2 breast cancer clinical trial.'"

Metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional changes associated with cellular responses to ICIs are assessed and modeled. Agent-based models are then used to study non-cell autonomous mechanisms that mediate therapeutic and adverse drug effects. We hope to thereby discover combinations of ICIs and specific patient populations in which therapeutic responses are high and toxicity is minimal.'"

Steady States and Cellular Transitions Associated with Carcinogenesis and Tumorprogression	Project	1		"'Cellular transitions between two distinct states are fundamental to many steps of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Such transitions are broadly studied, but general models have been historically limited to qualitative descriptions. This contrasts with phase transitions in physical systems, such as the transition between ferro- and paramagnetic states, which are well characterized within the context of the physico-chemical laws, and can be partially understood, in a predictive capacity, using simple, precise models such as the Ising model. Such models are based upon a system of interacting lattice sites. A parameter (e.g. temperature) is varied, and the fluctuations of the lattice sites are analyzed as the system approaches and passes through a critical point. These models are largely independent of many details of the specific system under study; the critical system-specific details are captured in the interactions between the lattice sites. Nevertheless, they can yield specific predictions that can, in principle, be experimentally verified, such as increased fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical point, and the loss of one or more degrees of freedom at the critical point. Ising-like in silico models have guided theoretical studies of transitions in various gene or protein regulatory networks, although resultant predictions can be challenging to experimentally test.\n\nWe seek a potentially general approach where the experimental input is a statistically large number of single cell measurements, with many analytes quantitatively measured from each cell. From this data we capture the fluctuations and thereby determine the correlations of many analytes. In an Ising model analogy, such measurements define the site interactions. These inputs permit straightforward theoretic models for resolving cellular steady states, transitions between steady states, and for making testable predictions. Studies of the chemically-induced-carcinogenesis transition are provided as preliminary data/proof of concept. For Aim 1 we develop a picture of cancer cell steady states using integrated metabolic and proteomic single cell assays. In Aims 2 and 3 we expand this approach to two apparent cellular transitions associated with cancer drug resistance: the adaptation of heterogeneous brain cancers to certain targeted inhibitors, and a drug-induced cellular de-differentiation observed in melanomas (and other tumors) in response to immunotherapy and targeted inhibitors. All aims are joint experiment/theory aims. Aims 2-3 involve in vivo testing of predictions.'"
Environmental Regulation of Cancer Stem Cell Plasticity in Metastasis	Project	1		"'Emerging evidence suggests that the physical environment of tumors, including mechanical stress and physico-chemical properties of extracellular matrix, combines with genetics and cell signaling to control plasticity of cancer stem cells during metastasis, the cause of death for > 90% of patients with cancer. Metastasis encompasses processes associated with mesenchymal (invasion) and epithelial (proliferation) phenotypes. Epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) transitions define subsets of cancer stem cells, which are implicated as critical drivers of metastasis. In particular, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and other disseminated tumor cells commonly exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal features, suggesting that cancer cells transition between these states. Studies of plasticity in cancer stem cells have focused predominantly on primary tumors, in part due to technological challenges of analyzing cell phenotypes and dynamics in other anatomic sites. To overcome these challenges, we will develop engineered environments for three key sites in tumor progression: primary tumor, intravascular compartment, and bone. We hypothesize that extracellular matrix and mechanical properties associated with distinct tumor environments in the metastatic cascade promote EMT and MET transitions of cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer. We will systematically interrogate this hypothesis using tunable 3D tissue-engineering technologies pioneered by our group. Specifically, we will develop (i) novel 3D scaffolds and protein matrices to engineer primary and metastatic tumor environments; (ii) microfluidic technologies to model the intravascular compartment; and (iii) new in vivo imaging technologies to measure environmental cues that drive EMT and MET transitions in cancer. Through this physical sciences approach, we will define tumor environments that drive stem cell state transitions in distinct phases of metastasis. EMT and MET transitions occur in almost all solid malignancies, so benefits of this research extend beyond breast cancer and ultimately will lead to better approaches to interrupt metastasis and improve outcomes for patients with multiple types of cancer.'"
Chromatin Mobility in Response to DNA Damage	Project	1		"'Genomic translocations are well-established drivers of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). T-MNs have poor outcomes and affect survivors of primary malignancies. It is not possible to predict which patients treated for a primary cancer will develop t-MN, which constitutes a major clinical challenge. A method to assess the risk of translocations after patient exposures to DNA damaging chemotherapy and radiations would inform therapeutic decisions. Translocations depend on the movements of broken DNA ends on non-homologous chromosomes. We developed a method based on diffractive optical elements (DOE) to track photoactivated chromatin reporters and map chromatin motions in the cell nucleus. Our preliminary data show fluctuations in chromatin mobility in response to DNA damage, which may impact on genomic translocations frequencies in cells with DNA damage. The goals for this PS-OP are (1) to develop new methodology to measure chromatin mobility in the 3D nuclear space, (2) to identify the mechanisms controlling chromatin motions after DNA damage and assess their functional consequences for DNA repair efficacy, repair quality, and translocations frequencies, and (3) to test for clinically relevant associations between chromatin motions and genomic translocations using hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell samples from t-MN patients and healthy donors (translational goal). Characterizing the physical origins of genomic translocations may yield new methods to predict, and new targets to prevent, genomic rearrangements driving cancer initiation. Beyond the proposed research focused on chromatin motions during DNA repair, we anticipate broad applicability of our novel 3D imaging resources to study chromatin in multiple contexts.'"
Mechanisms of Impaired T-Cell Mechanosensing of Melanoma Antiagents	Project	1		"'This project investigates how the tumor microenvironment (TME) impairs in situ interactions of T-cell surface molecules with counter-molecules on the melanoma cells to suppress anti-tumor immunity. Detailed mechanistic understanding will be obtained by an integrated approach that combines physical science (PS) based tools with two complementary pre-clinical mouse models of melanoma T cell immunity, which will be further tested using bio specimens from melanoma patients. The molecular focus is the T-cell receptor (TCR) that initiates the T-cell antigen recognition upon binding to peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC), and the coreceptor CD8 that co-ligates with the pMHC. The first PS tool is single-molecule force techniques for quantifying TCR mechanosensing through in situ kinetic analyses of molecular interactions with concurrent imaging of intracellular signals on a single cell. The second PS tool is DNA-based digital tension probes that report cell generated pulling forces on the TCR and CD8 via engaged pMHC. One animal model is a recognized standard that uses melanoma conjugated with a chicken ovalbumin antigen recognized by the OT-I TCR. The other animal model is a melanoma self-antigen gp100 in conjunction with JR209 humanized transgenic mice. By analyzing the mechanically regulated two-dimensional (2D) ligand binding of TCR and/or CD8 at the T-cell membrane, we observed that the TCR avidities for the pMHC of CD8 T cells infiltrating primary murine melanomas grown in vivo are significantly reduced relative to T cells within non-tumor associated tissues (spleen and blood). Such differential avidities were not detected by the conventional assay using pMHC tetramer, attesting to the power of our mechanics-based methods for analyzing TCR–pMHC interactions. We also found melanomas to substantially alter the force-dependent TCR–pMHC bond durability: in tumor-free animals, the TCR and pMHC formed a catch-slip bond whose lifetime first increased and then decreased with increasing force, which we have previously demonstrated to govern T cell signaling and effector function, whereas in melanoma-bearing animals, the TCR–pMHC bond lifetime only decreased with increasing force, i.e., behaved as a slip bond and were associated with reduced T cell effector functions. We hypothesize that deficient CD8 T cell immunity in melanoma results, at least in part, from impaired antigen recognition within the TME, as manifested by the altered TCR mechanosensing of pMHC. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: 1) Determine the molecular interactions crucial to T cell antigen recognition that are impaired by the TME; 2) Define the functional consequences of suppressed T cell antigen recognition; and 3) Elucidate the mechanisms underlying the TME suppression of T cell antigen recognition. Completing these aims has the potential to identify new immunotherapeutic targets for the treatment of melanoma to improve the outcomes of patients with advanced disease.'"
"Systems approaches to understanding the relationships between genotype, signaling, and therapeutic efficacy"	Project	1		"'The promise of precision medicine for cancer is a personalized therapeutic strategy based on the molecular features of an individual’s tumor. This concept is most effectively demonstrated by the successes in targeting oncogenic kinases with small molecules or antibody inhibitors. But while successes have garnered significant attention in recent years, precision medicine has not made an impact for the vast majority of cancer patients. The high profile successes associated with inhibitors of kinases such as ABL, EGFR, ALK, and B-RAF bring to the forefront the major disappointment associated with efforts to establish precision medicine for cancers expressing mutant K-RAS. K-RAS mutations occur in 15% of all cancers, but are significantly enriched in three of the four most deadly forms: lung, colorectal, and pancreatic. Importantly, KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to conventional and targeted therapies, most notably therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor. As such, three decades after the initial identification of KRAS mutations in human cancers, prospective knowledge of K-RAS mutation state in a given cancer is useful largely only for its ability to predict negative response to therapy. The major shortfall of the precision medicine movement is the lack of direct inhibitors for specific oncogenic events, such as K-RAS mutation. The alternative to direct inhibition of an activated oncoprotein is to target downstream pathways, but this requires an absolute understanding of contextual cues that influence oncogenic effector signaling. Lack of depth in our understanding of the relationship between genotype, network signaling state, and therapeutic response leads to ineffective precision medicine. With its focus on network-level biology and its ability to uncover molecular mechanisms through computational analysis, systems biology provides a means to overcome this lack of understanding. This project is designed to take advantage of the broad array of expertise within our research community in order to make precision medicine a realistic goal for patients with K-RAS mutant cancer.'"
Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement	Project	1		"'Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic strategies, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, although the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL-targeted therapy especially challenging.\n\nWe propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.\n\nThis work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance.'"
An Integrated Systems Approach for Incompletely Penetrant Onco-phenotypes	Project	1		"'Perturbation of cancer cells often leads to heterogeneous outcomes, in that most cells exhibit a dominant phenotype, but the rest appear resistant or hypersensitive to the perturbation. If the penetrance of such a phenotype is heritably incomplete, then it becomes extremely difficult to decipher the upstream molecular events that heterogenize the population and cause response variability. By combining quantitative measurements with dynamical models, systems approaches should be useful if provided with a core network of important biomolecules. The daunting hurdle lies in identifying phenotype-relevant regulatory heterogeneities that define the network for penetrance at the single-cell level. Our proposal seeks to exploit a new approach, called stochastic frequency matching (SFM), for elaborating the molecular networks upstream of incompletely penetrant phenotypes. SFM identifies and parameterizes single-cell heterogeneities—which emerge after a uniform perturbation but before the appearance of a variable phenotype—to hone in on regulatory states corresponding to future penetrance. For an onco-phenotype incompletely triggered by ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in 3D cultured breast epithelia, we implemented SFM using microarrays to uncover a network of critical nucleocytoplasmic regulators. The goals of this proposal are to apply systems approaches to the ErbB nucleocytoplasmic network and adapt SFM more broadly to RNA sequencing of breast cancer patients with ErbB amplification. Based on our provisional SFM results, we hypothesize that ErbB signaling heterogeneously reconfigures the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling state of cells to determine incomplete penetrance of the onco-phenotype. The aims are to: 1) Identify network-level mechanisms for the incompletely penetrant ErbB1:ErbB2 phenotype. 2) Determine whether drivers of incomplete penetrance in 3D define shuttling states in human cancers and promote ErbB2-driven mammary tumors in mice. 3) Sequence and parameterize regulatory-state heterogeneity in HER2+ breast cancers to assemble patient-specific network models of shuttling variability and sensitivity. Drivers of incomplete penetrance are important for understanding transitions during tumor initiation-progression and for developing therapeutic interventions with more reliable patient outcomes. SFM gives the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium a means to identify driver networks in a comprehensive and hypothesis-driven way.'"
Phenotype Transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer - CA215845	Project	1		"'The goal of our U01 project to develop rational systems approaches to treat cancer. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is arguably the most aggressive form of lung cancer, and while modern treatment strategies are initially highly effective, tumors quickly relapse, resistant to further therapies. We seek to decode the gene-regulatory processes that underlie SCLC’s phenotypic response to treatment, and develop clinically viable strategies to reprogram those circuits, while keeping cells locked into drug-sensitive states. Our major driving questions are: How does SCLC heterogeneity contribute dynamic adaptation to treatment? What regulatory mechanisms govern this response, and how are they coordinated? How can these regulatory mechanisms be manipulated to drive SCLC cells toward therapeutically desirable phenotypes? What molecular species can be targeted therapeutically to affect these mechanisms? To this end we will integrate bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, and experimentation to provide a systems-level understanding of SCLC drug response and optimal treatment strategies.'"
Model-based Prediction of Redox-Modulated Responses to Cancer Treatments	Project	1		"'The goal of our U01 project is to advance precision medicine through consideration of cancer redox metabolism when predicting patient-specific responses to therapies. While the arsenal of approaches to selectively killing cancer cells is increasing, the majority of treatments rely on redox alterations of tumor cells and their microenvironment through chemotherapy, radiation, or some combination thereof. Compared to other cancers, the treatment options available for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) patients are particularly limited with only one targeted therapy currently approved by FDA for treatment; therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies and methods to enable systematic/predictive selection of patients for treatment with targeted agents.\n\nSpecifically, we hypothesize that the response to a new class of redox-based chemotherapeutics can be predicted and enhanced by identifying specific metabolic network features contributing to the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox balance and overall levels associated with the specific mechanism of action. We will be investigating the NAD(P)H-driven responses to the quinone-based chemotherapeutics, beta-lapachone (ß-Lap) and isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) in laboratory models and clinical specimens of HNSCC. This project will require integration and expansion of our prior successful models of drug bioactivation networks and redox metabolic systems in a comprehensive systems-level approach to improve understanding and enhance prediction of phenotype-specific responses to chemotherapeutic strategies. Development and validation of predictive models of β-Lap or IB-DBQ lethality in HNSCC cell lines will rely upon novel genome-wide metabolomics approaches to identify key enzymatic contributors to NAD(P)H levels required for driving drug metabolism and DNA lesion repair. The predictive capabilities of our computational models will be enhanced by accounting for metabolic diversity across HNSCC tumors and RNAi manipulation of enzyme levels to extract predictive proteomic/metabolic signatures associated with quinone redox cycling. Finally, the model-based predictions of therapeutic outcomes will be tested with HNSCC clinical specimens via ex vivo assays and targeted metabolic profiling. We anticipate that our multi-disciplinary project – relying on a team of investigators in pharmacology, oncology, redox biology, mass spectrometry, and computational modeling – will identify metabolic regulatory features applicable to the treatment of other cancers by molecular or systemic chemotherapies.'"
Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma	Project	1		"'Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied.\n\nA significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone.\n\nIn Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co-localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients.\n\nThis proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit.'"
A plasticity and reprogramming paradigm for therapy resistance at the single cell level	Project	1		"'Targeted therapies in melanoma have shown enormous promise in the sense that they can show dramatic reductions in tumor burden, with melanoma being a particularly stark example. However, this promise has failed to be fully realized because of the emergence of resistant tumor cells, which repopulate the tumor and are subsequently difficult or impossible to treat effectively. Typically, scientists have thought of therapy resistance as having genetic origins, with rare mutant tumor cells surviving therapy because of a mutation that causes resistance. Recent work from our labs using advanced single cell analysis, however, suggest that, at the point of attack, there may be other, complementary, non-genetic mechanisms that could also govern exactly why some rare cells are able to evade the effects of the therapy. Subsequently, the targeted therapy itself can reprogram these rare cells into a stably resistant population. This more nuanced “plasticity and reprogramming” view of resistance at the single cell level has opened the possibility of a far richer set of targets that can be exploited for forestalling therapy resistance; however, the current set of tools and models, both experimental and computational, for identifying these targets are underdeveloped and the origin of these biological processes remain mysterious. Here, we propose to develop and apply new concepts and methods in experimental and computational single cell biology to tackle the problem of non-genetic therapy resistance, translating our basic science results towards the clinic through the use of sophisticated in vivo models of melanoma. Our goal is to identify and validate the pathways that govern cellular plasticity in melanoma, develop computational tools to identify the gene networks that drive the formation of cellular plasticity, and ultimately test these interactions in in vivo mouse models. In conjunction, we developing tools for also specifically targeting the reprogramming phase of resistance, ultimately using all these data collectively to inform models of dosing regiments that we can test in in vivo systems.

Multiscale systems biology modeling to exploit tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk in colorectal cancer	Project	1		"'The survival rate for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is less than 10%, and resistance to standard therapies is a key contributor to this high rate of morbidity and mortality. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a dominant cellular component of the tumor stroma, play a significant role in drug resistance by contributing to the altered metabolism that is a hallmark of CRC. Despite many computational models of colorectal cancer growth and progression, there is currently no quantitative spatiotemporal description of the interactions between colon cancer cells and CAF cells, or the metabolic dependencies of these two cell populations. Thus quantifying the collective cell dynamics (i.e. cooperation or competition) of tumor and CAF cells in their metabolic ecosystem may provide insight needed to develop optimal cancer therapies.\n\nOur U01 addresses this limitation by applying a systems biology approach comprised of novel mathematical frameworks across scales, quantitative imaging techniques, and physiologically-relevant preclinical models to investigate reciprocal metabolic reprogramming that occurs between tumor cells and CAFs. We hypothesize that exploiting tumor-stromal metabolic dependencies will enhance the effects of therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor growth. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three aims that combine computational and experimental studies: (1) Develop computational models of intracellular metabolic pathways in CRC cells and CAFs that promote colon cancer proliferation; (2) Develop a spatial multiscale model of colon cancer cell growth, integrating the pathway models of tumor-CAF metabolic crosstalk; and (3) explore these data-driven models with supercomputing resources to identify and validate treatment strategies that exploit tumor and CAF metabolism.\n![project description](https://csbconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U01_website_schematic_USC_IU_final.png)'"
Rewiring of regulatory networks in breast cancer by transcription factor isoforms	Project	1		"'One of the ultimate goals of cancer systems biology is to generate predictive and dynamic models of tumorigenesis by identifying and quantifying all perturbed functional interactions in a cancerous cellular system. The central hypothesis of our CSBC is that functional perturbations emerging from cancer-specific gene expression of alternative isoforms are crucial for tumorigenesis. Genome alterations such as amplification, deletion, translocations and mutations, are often considered primary events of cancer progression. However, cancer-specific isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, alternative sites of transcriptional initiation, and/or alternative transcriptional termination sites, have also been shown to have functional impact on tumorigenesis. \nChanges in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by transcription factor (TF) isoforms have been shown to play a major role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in multiple types of cancer. What remains unclear is the extent to which differences in TF isoforms between normal and cancer tissue affect global GRNs and how such regulatory network rewiring leads to altered gene expression programs in cancer. In this CSBC project, we are characterizing and modeling the effect(s) of large numbers of breast cancer-specific TF isoforms in the context of cancer interactome networks. We will combine network modeling and high-throughput systematic experimental strategies at the level of molecular protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to predict cancer drivers and suppressors. \nAltogether, this project will contextualize and functionalize large numbers of TF isoforms implicated in breast cancer. Lessons learned from this project will lead to the identification of novel cancer drivers and suppressors, the generation of mechanistic models of GRN rewiring in cancer and provide a framework for the design of novel therapeutics. The resulting hypotheses will be tested experimentally using various large-scale functional assays in breast cancer cells as a model system. As part of the experimental testing, we will establish state-of-the-art genome editing methodologies for testing the effects of isoform-specific perturbations on GRNs in mammalian cells.'"
Eco-Evolutionary dynamics of NSCLC to immunotherapy - Response and Resistance	Project	1		"'The Moffitt Integrated Mathematical Oncology (IMO) Department, through collaborations with oncologists, cancer biologists, evolutionary biologists, and imaging scientists, has pioneered the integration of evolutionary dynamics into cancer treatment protocols. In pre-clinical experiments and now with ongoing clinical trials, we have demonstrated that therapies incorporating evolutionary dynamics can significantly improve outcomes using currently available treatments. Major “lessons learned” from this experience include 1) Optimal therapy design requires maximal understanding of the multiscale dynamics that provide the “menu” of resistance strategies for cancer cells undergoing treatment; 2) The eco-evolutionary forces that govern response and resistance in cancer therapy are dominated by non-linear dynamics that defy intuitive analysis and can only be predicted through mathematical models and computational simulation; and 3) Clinical data are typically sparse and can be obtained only in periodic “snapshots” from biopsies or imaging studies. Converting static information to evolutionary dynamics requires mathematical tools. In this U01 we will apply these investigational principles to immunotherapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). During the past decade, the Moffitt Thoracic Oncology Department has pioneered new strategies using immunotherapy for NSCLC. In almost 500 patients treated with immunotherapy at Moffitt, the response rate (CR, PR, and SD) is 30 to 45%. Most responses are followed by evolution of resistance and progression but some patients in each category have experienced durable responses maintained for >1 year. \n\nOur underlying hypothesis is that the observed results from immunotherapy can be improved with sufficient understanding of the evolutionary (cellular and molecular) and ecological (tissue) dynamics that govern response and resistance of NSCLC to immunotherapy. There is clear evidence that integration of other agents can enhance NSCLC response to immunotherapy. But, as we have previously demonstrated, administration of cytotoxic drugs in heterogeneous cancers typically elicits complex, often non-intuitive evolutionary dynamics and integration of evolutionary mathematical models into the clinical protocols can significantly improve outcomes. \n\nTo develop such models we will analyze a Moffitt NSCLC immunotherapy cohort to investigate the evolutionary (molecular, cellular) as well as ecological (histological and radiological) dynamics that govern response and resistance to immunotherapy. These investigations will be supplemented with ex vivo studies in which tumor and immune cells obtained from resected primary tumors are dispersed in culture allowing the immediate response to immunotherapy agents to be assessed. We will also perform in vitro studies that dissect the wide range of cellular and tissue ecological engineering strategies available to NSCLC cells as well as the timescales of immunotherapy adaptation. Finally, we will test predictive power of our developed mathematical models to prospectively use pre-therapy data to predict outcomes from anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and calibrate these results from ongoing clinical trials in NSCLC at Moffitt.'"
Cancer Systems Biology at UC Irvine	Project	1	Patterned Heterogeneity in Colon Cancer 	"'PIs: Christopher C.W. Hughes, Marian Waterman; Key Personnel: Steven D. Allison, Michelle Digman, Robert A. Edwards, Kai Kessenbrock, Arthur Lander, John Lowengrub, Qing Nie\n\nSolid tumors are complex masses of cancer cells with a multitude of genetic, epigenetic, morphologic and metabolic phenotypes. This heterogeneous condition is a formidable barrier to treating cancer as it underlies the ability of tumors to adapt to nutrient starvation, immune challenges and to develop resistance to cancer treatments – the most common cause of mortality. Non-genetic heterogeneity in gene expression, signaling and metabolism are considered to be some of the most dynamic forms of heterogeneity and the most responsive to the tumor microenvironment. But we currently understand little about such heterogeneity, both mechanistically (what drives it) and functionally (how it helps the tumor). Non-genetic heterogeneity is very challenging to study, partly because of a limited toolbox and partly for lack of tractable model systems. Consequently, there are fundamental unknowns about how such heterogeneity arises and what its role in tumor growth and drug resistance really is.\n\nIn preliminary and published work, we observed heterogeneity in a xenograft model of colon cancer where the heterogeneity is patterned in a manner suggestive of a spatially self-organizing process (such as Turing-patterning). What is heterogeneous in these tumors is both Wnt signaling (thought to be the essential driver of proliferation in these cells), and metabolism (the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation). In particular, the pattern consists of cell clusters, or spots, in which biomarkers of Wnt signaling are higher than in surrounding regions. These spots also mark regions of glycolytic metabolism. These patterns are likely connected through Wnt regulation of the expression of genes that control metabolism, as identified in our earlier work, and possibly through Wnt-Turing patterning of cancer cell subpopulations. Interestingly, glycolytic heterogeneity has recently been proposed to serve as the basis for resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy, one of the most important clinical problems in colorectal cancer. The short time scale of the xenografting (14-21 days), the reproducibility of the heterogeneity across genetically identical cell lines, and sites of injection, all suggest that this heterogeneity is not genetic.\n\nIn this project, Hughes, Waterman and their team seek to understand the causes of the observed heterogeneity in colon cancer, the reason why spatial patterns of heterogeneity develop spontaneously, the consequences of such heterogeneity for the growth of tumor cells, and whether this, or possibly other, forms of heterogeneity indeed drive resistance to therapy (and if so, why). They are addressing these questions by 1) explaining the relationships between heterogeneity, patterning and growth of colon tumors; 2) defining the general principles linking heterogeneity, patterning and growth in colon tumors; and 3) defining the link between heterogeneity and drug resistance.\n\n![Fig1](https://casb.uci.edu/files/2018/08/project-1-figure-1.jpg)\nFigure 1. Xenograft colon tumors reveal a spotted pattern of metabolic (A) and Wnt signaling (B) heterogeneity; concordant heterogeneity in metabolism and Wnt signaling is present in primary patient tumors (C).

In (E/Middle Panel) Ligand and receptor pairs among several cell clusters of the human and mouse (right panels in E) cells are shown. (F) Candidate mathematical model for simulating SW480 tumors.\n\n\nThe foundation of the project is multi-scale modeling of stochastic and self-organizing processes that potentially explains overt differences in tumor growth, patterning of heterogeneity and metabolism, and the most likely mechanisms for drug resistance. The experimental tools pair xenograft studies with a novel platform for generating fully vascularized micro-tumors in vitro; the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging to read out the metabolic states of unlabeled, living cells, and the use of single cell transcriptomics\nto identify cell states, the gene expression signatures that define them and signaling and adhesion molecules that mediate communication among the cells. Modeling predictions of strategies that re-establish drug sensitivity will be tested via genetic engineering (CRISPR/Cas9) or small molecule drug therapies. The overarching goal of the work is to discover deep insights into the origins and consequences of tumor heterogeneity in an especially manipulable, and clinically relevant tumor system. The integration of this work with Projects 2 and 3, which focus on different cancer types (melanoma and chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively), enables us to identify general principles that underlie how the in vivo behaviors of transformed cells are constrained by rules inherited from the communities of diverse, interacting cell types and lineage hierarchies within which those cells arise.'"
Cancer Systems Biology at UC Irvine	Project	2	Understanding the Cellular Origins of Melanoma 	"'PIs: Anand Ganesan, Arthur Lander; Key Personnel: Devon A. Lawson, John Lowengrub, Bruce Tromberg, Tatiana Krasieva\n\nMelanoma, a tumor resistant to therapy in late stages, is curable by excision when caught early. Early melanomas can be difficult to distinguish from benign, pigmented “moles”, i.e. melanocytic nevi; this leads to unnecessary excision of many normal nevi while early melanomas are often missed. Nevi and melanomas share more than morphological features: Clinical and experimental data show that ~90% of nevi are initiated when melanocytes acquire an activating mutation in the BRAF oncogene, the same oncogenic mutation observed in >60% of melanomas. Yet nevi spontaneously stop growing. This is usually attributed to “oncogene-induced senescence,” but the fact that nevi readily re-grow after incomplete excision, or in response to UV-irradiation, and can sometimes evolve to melanoma, suggest nevi are not “senescent” but reversibly growth-arrested. Nevi also spontaneously regress, a process that appears to involve the immune system.\n\nIn preliminary work, we investigated nevus dynamics in a mouse model of inducible Braf activation, which mimics human nevus formation and also produces melanomas either at low frequency or when additional oncogenic mutations are added (e.g., in Pten). We found that as we activate Braf in more melanocytes, such that nevi become more numerous and closely-spaced, the smaller individual nevi become—as if nevi, when close together enough, inhibit each other’s growth. Such behavior is predicted by mathematical models of growth control based on feedback through diffusible signaling molecules. Such models achieve robust control when feedback regulates decisions between self-renewal and progression to alternate cell states or fates. Interestingly, when we look closely at the nevi in this model, we see that there are, in fact, two distinct cell types: highly pigmented nevus body cells and a scattered, lightly pigmented melanocyte population that forms a “veil” around the pigmented cells that had not been observed before. These veil cells are usually not seen unless the melanocyte lineage is fluorescently-labeled with GFP. Single cell RNA-sequencing suggests that these cells likely communicate through ligands and receptors they differentially express.\n\nIn this project, Ganesan, Lander and their team seek to understand the role of the nevus body and veil cell types in mouse models that produce both nevi and melanoma,\n\n![fig2](https://casb.uci.edu/files/2018/08/project-2-figure-2.jpg)\nFigure 2.

The goal of the work is to build a solid molecular and cellular framework on which to base clinical decisions about melanoma prevention, detection and treatment. They are addressing these issues by 1) Explaining feedback growth dynamics in melanocytic nevi; 2) Elucidating how melanomas escape growth control mechanisms that arrest nevi; and 3) Revealing how the immune system targets nevi, and how this affects melanoma development.\n\nThis project integrates multiscale mathematical modeling with experiments in mice using a nevus-forming inducible activated Braf model, and a version of the same model that combines Braf activation with inducible loss of one allele of Pten, leading to the reliable production of both nevi and melanoma tumors. We are developing hypotheses that can explain the spatiotemporal dynamics and spatial statistics of nevus and melanoma development in these models, including potential bifurcations that account for the development of both nevi and melanoma in the same mouse. We are investigating the reasons why some cells escape from growth control, while others do not. We anticipate that this is unlikely to be due to a requirement for inactivation of the other Pten allele, and instead believe that escape may more likely be due to the spatial dynamics of collective feedback. The results are expected to shed light on signaling pathways that could be manipulated to prevent or treat melanoma. Live cell imaging, focused laser ablation, immunohistochemistry, and time-course single cell RNA-sequencing are used to identify potential positive and negative feedback regulators that drive the mathematical models, and experiments are used to test model-based predictions concerning the roles that such molecules play. Finally, an investigation of spontaneous regression, which occurs with both mouse and human nevi, provides clues into how the immune system efficiently recognizes melanocyte overgrowth. Since immunotherapy has recently emerged as a promising therapy for melanoma, this study is expected to reveal whether immunotherapy leverages an existing immune program for eliminating nevi, and if so, how that program is carried out, and how melanomas typically escape from it. Such information should aid in developing new prevention and therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease. The integration of this work with Projects 1 and 3 occurs through the use of scRNA-seq as a tool for hypothesis generation and development and through the application of mathematical models that have similar underlying structures (cell state transitions, proliferation and quiescence, positive and negative feedback), but differ in their context (e.g., spatial in Projects 1 and 2 vs. non-spatial in Project 3).'"
Cancer Systems Biology at UC Irvine	Project	3	Modeling malignant myelopoiesis to increase efficacy of targeted leukemia therapy 	"'PI: Richard Van Etten; Key Personnel: Kai Kessenbrock, Natalia Komarova, John S. Lowengrub, Qing Nie, Dominik Wodarz, Xiaohui Xie, Nilamani Jena\n\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML), one of the most prevalent of human leukemias, is a natural model of dysregulated granulopoiesis driven by a single genetic abnormality in a hematopoietic stem cell, the BCR-ABL1 gene fusion. Although therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate has dramatically lowered the death rate in CML, lifelong treatment is needed and the associated economic costs are significant. Two major unaddressed questions are to understand the mechanism of primary resistance to TKI therapy (affecting ~10-15% of newly diagnosed CML patients), and to identify strategies to increase the frequency of complete molecular remission (CMR) in patients treated with TKIs and subsequently the rate of treatment-free remission (TFR), which may represent a surrogate for permanent cure of the disease. The scientific premise of this project is that new and clinically relevant insights into the biology of CML and its response to therapy can be gained by a more physiologically accurate mathematical model of the disease.\n\nWhile mathematical models of CML have been developed by several groups, these models tend to be highly simplified and largely omit feedback interactions among the different hematopoietic components. These models are designed to fit clinical data sets of the response of patient populations to TKI therapy but unfortunately, they have not proven useful for understanding primary TKI resistance or for predicting TFR. In preliminary work, we found that nonlinear models that incorporate feedback are more robust, have a better fit to alternative patterns of patient response than simple linear models used previously, and allow predictions about the effects of interventions affecting parameters (such as cell cycle status) subject to feedback mechanisms on the response to TKI therapy. Preliminary analyses from prototype feedback models have already raised two provocative hypotheses about CML. The first is that the initial response to TKI therapy may depend on the relative size of the leukemic stem cell clone, which will be analyzed by TKI treatment of mice engrafted with different levels of BCR-ABL1+ stem cells. The second is that interventions that increase leukemic stem cell cycling may sensitize this population to killing by TKIs.\n\nIn this project, Van Etten and his team seek to develop improved mathematical models of chronic phase CML and the response to TKI therapy, to validate these models using data from a binary transgenic mouse model of CML and from human CML patients, and to utilize the models to test several hypotheses about the response of CML to therapy and to predict strategies for improving the treatment-free remission rate in CML. We address these issues by 1) Developing data-driven, dynamic models of CML hematopoiesis incorporating feedback control; 2) Measuring granulocytopoiesis parameters in a CML mouse model and in human CML patients; 3) Testing model-driven hypotheses about the response of CML to therapy and informing strategies for improving the treatment-free remission rate in CML.\n\n![fig3](https://casb.uci.edu/files/2018/08/project-3-figure-3.jpg)\nFigure 3. (A) Illustrative nonlinear feedback models of hematopoiesis. The red box indicates the model used in (B). (B) Increased leukemic stem cell (LSC) cycling predicts faster LSC decline on TKI therapy. The results correspond to different LSC cycling parameters applied (expressed as ratio of LSC to multipotential progenitor (MPP) cycling rate). Note the increasing negative slope of the second linear phase with increased cycling. (C,D) Selective decrement of HSC compartment increases MPP proliferation. Mice were irradiated (50 cGy), injected 24h post-radiation with BrdU and analyzed 12h later. (C) 50 cGy irradiation significantly (P=0.018) decreased the size (%LSK) of the HSC compartment (right panel) at 36h without a significant effect on the MPP compartment (left panel). (D) Reduction in HSC pool by low-dose radiation dramatically increases proliferation of the MPP compartment, supporting the existence of a negative feedback loop in the model above. (E) t-SNE analysis of scRNA-seq data from the MPP population isolated from mice with BCR-ABL1-induced CML shows eight separate subpopulations. (F) Expression of sorted lineage markers mapped on the t-SNE plot from (E). (G) Expression of GFP (marking leukemic MPP) and MPP/HSC markers mapped onto the t-SNE plot from (E).\n\nMachine-based automated model selection methods are being utilized to arrive at a mathematical model that maintains appropriate stability and homeostasis, responds physiologically to stress and depletion of different cell compartments, and conforms to the limited existing qualitative data on CML hematopoiesis derived from mouse models and patient studies. To validate and inform potential models, binary/conditional BCR-ABL1 transgenic donor mice are being used to generate mixed BM chimeras via transplantation of high doses of unfractionated marrow cells without use of conditioning radiation. Recipients bearing a clone of BCR-ABL1+ cells have leukemia induced by withdrawal of doxycycline, leukemic mice are treated with BrdU or subjected to short-term stable isotope labeling with D2-glucose, marrow and spleen stem and progenitor compartments isolated by flow cytometry, and cell cycle and kinetic parameters estimated to inform the mathematical models. Single cell transcriptome profiling is used to investigate the heterogeneity of the MPP compartment and to discover potential regulatory mechanisms mediated by cytokine/receptor interactions. Feedback relationships are tested via direct in vivo manipulation using depleting monoclonal antibodies and through a novel mouse that targets metronidazole cytotoxicity to specific cell compartments. Parallel studies of human CML progenitor flux will be carried out through a clinical protocol of short-term D2-glucose labeling in patients presenting with suspected CML prior to diagnostic BM biopsy. The response to TKI therapy is also being analyzed. The integration of this work with Projects 1 and 2 occurs through the use of scRNA-seq as a tool for hypothesis generation and development and through the application of nonlinear mathematical models that have similar underlying structures (cell state transitions, proliferation and quiescence, positive and negative feedback), although the models in Project 3 are non-spatial.'"

Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center	Project	1	Organismal Evolution and Cancer Defenses 	"'_PIs: Maley, Kokko, Boddy; Co-Is: Aktipis, Harrison, Zehnder_\n\nCancer has been an important selective pressure for organisms and a great deal of variation in cancer rates exist across species. Why do species vary in their susceptibility to cancer and what mechanisms are responsible for this variation? Life history theory (LHT) may provide an explanation for these differences. LHT is an evolutionary and ecological approach that focuses on organism-level tradeoffs between growth, maintenance and reproduction. Organisms can either live fast and die young, or live slowly and die old, or anywhere in between. Cancer suppression is an important component of building a robust body that can live into old age. Our previous models show that lower levels of cancer defense can be favored by natural selection when there are tradeoffs with traits such as reproductive competitiveness, body size, and longevity. Here we use real life history parameters to predict cancer rates across animals and test the predictions with a highly curated comparative oncology dataset, including animals from major orders of reptiles, birds, fish, amphibians and mammals. Additionally, we will analyze the genomes of mammalian species to identify patterns of selection and mutation in tumor suppressor genes. Our approach combines mathematical modeling, comparative techniques, evolutionary theory, genomic sequencing, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics to study cancer suppression. We are particularly interested in identifying cancer resistant species, discovering how they prevent cancer, and translating that into better cancer prevention for humans.\n\n![img2](https://csbconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ASU_Elephant-mouse.jpg)\nLife history strategies fall on a continuum from fast to slow, and organisms with a fast life history strategy allocate less energy to somatic maintenance (i.e. cancer defense), while slow life history organism have higher investment in cancer defenses, such as DNA damage sensitivity\nImpact: More cancers could be prevented if we better understand the evolution of cancer defense mechanisms and other biological parameters that make humans more susceptible to cancer than other species. We can leverage these findings to develop novel tools for prevention and clinical management of human cancers. Comparative oncology offers a unique opportunity to see how evolution has, over millions of years, led to both cancer defense mechanisms and why certain forms of susceptibility remain.'"

The compartmentalization of cells into small replicative units can modify evolution because selection and drift (random cell turnover) is limited to immediately adjacent cells. The advantages of analyzing small replicative units are that experimentally they large enough to measure with conventional methods yet small enough to simulate in detail. Characterizing somatic cell evolution in replicative units can lead to better understanding of tumor evolution because selection or drift first occurs at the cell-cell level.\n\nWe will sample multiple colon crypts from different aged individuals and multiple tumor glands from opposite sides of 20 colorectal tumors (adenomas and CRCs). Crypts from different species will also be compared with the human data. For each crypt or gland we will document genetic alterations (whole genome sequencing), epigenetic alterations (ATAC-seq), and expression. Combining epigenetic and genetic evolution is important because phenotypic plasticity can mimic clonal evolution when epigenetic modulation allows a single genome to express multiple phenotypes. This data will be modeled through simulations to better understand somatic cell proliferation (division and death) within small replicative units, specifically to determine whether selection or neutral drift are more common during normal human aging and tumor progression.\n\nThis Project will also compare the evolutionary biology of fibroblasts. We will test the predictions of Project 1 for the mutation rates, proliferation rates, apoptosis rates, DNA damage response, and stress responses of early passage, primary fibroblasts from species with a wide variety of life history traits.

In this Project, we will develop predictive biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes. The innovation is that the biomarkers will be direct measures of evolution. Such evolution-based biomarkers also provide mechanistic understanding for what aspects of evolution most impact survival. To fully characterize tumor evolution, it is necessary to measure both how tumor cells evolve and the host ecology.\n\nIn Aim 1, mutations detected by whole exome sequencing of CRC cohorts with long-term follow-up will be classified as public (clonal) and private (subclonal). CRCs will then be subclassified with a newly developed algorithm that can infer selection (positive, neutral, negative) based on private mutation frequencies, where selection preferentially increases (positive) or decreases (negative) subclone subsets. In Aim 2, we will scan microscope sections from the above tumors, using a unique automated platform that can identify cells and quantify tumor microenvironments with respect to lymphocytes and stromal cells. To determine if host ecological heterogeneity reflects responses to specific tumor subclones, we will overlay private mutation distributions on the same microscope slides.\nWe will combine tumor evolution and the host reaction into a single evolution-ecology (Evo-Eco) index that summarizes the underlying evolutionary struggle. For example, patients with aggressive tumors (positive selection) and supportive environments are likely to have poorer outcomes relative to patients with tumors under negative selection and repressive environments. We will validate our Evo-Eco index on another cohort of CRCs. If successful, these studies will yield improved CRC predictive biomarkers.'"
